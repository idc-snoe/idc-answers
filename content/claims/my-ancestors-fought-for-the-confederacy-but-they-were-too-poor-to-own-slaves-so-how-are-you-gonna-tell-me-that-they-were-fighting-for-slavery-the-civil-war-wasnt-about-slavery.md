[Constitution of the Confederate States](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_csa.asp):  
Article 1, section 4 :  
  
"No bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law denying or impairing the right of property in negro slaves shall be passed."  
  
Article 4, section 2:  
  
"The citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States; and shall have the right of transit and sojourn in any State of this Confederacy, with their slaves and other property; and the right of property in said slaves shall not be thereby impaired."  
  
"No slave or other person held to service or labor in any State or Territory of the Confederate States, under the laws thereof, escaping or lawfully carried into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor; but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such slave belongs,. or to whom such service or labor may be due."  
  
"The Confederate States may acquire new territory; and Congress shall have power to legislate and provide governments for the inhabitants of all territory belonging to the Confederate States, lying without the limits of the several Sates; and may permit them, at such times, and in such manner as it may by law provide, to form States to be admitted into the Confederacy. In all such territory the institution of negro slavery, as it now exists in the Confederate States, shall be recognized and protected be Congress and by the Territorial government; and the inhabitants of the several Confederate States and Territories shall have the right to take to such Territory any slaves lawfully held by them in any of the States or Territories of the Confederate States."  
  
A key component of the racist ideology of the Confederacy was that the enslavement and general oppression of Black people were necessary for the freedom of white people, including white people who did not own slaves. Even the poorest white person was better off than an enslaved Black person (or any Black person) in material terms. So non-slave-owning white people did have a real material interest of the subordination of Black people. This was compounded by the fact that a key myth of pro-slavery ideology was that slavery was necessary for white people to keep what they had, no matter how little that was.  
  
Additionally, it is perfectly possible to support something even if you don't participate in it. For instance, some believe that cannabis should be legal even though they don't use it. Similarly, the non-slave-owning ancestors of the person(s) asking this question could easily have supported slavery without actually owning anyone as an enslaved person.  
  
Finally, [to quote Alexander Stephens, vice president of the Confederacy](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/1861stephens.asp):  
  
"the new Constitution has put at rest forever all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institutions-African slavery as it exists among us-the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution.  
\[â€¦\]  
Our new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and moral condition."  
  
Why one would argue that supporting the Confederacy was not "necessarily" about slavery when the Confederacy's leaders say the **exact opposite** is beyond us (but not really).
