Technically, it is correct that anyone who doesn't defend marginalized people who look physically different than them, even when choosing to be neutral, is a racist in some way.  
  
The foundation of Western society is based upon the construction of whiteness, which led to white supremacy. Those who are not being oppressed by the system of whiteness are usually those who uphold this system, and deny that systemic racism exists. These people who consciously or unconsciously defend whiteness could be anyone from average working-class folks, to Liberals, to "Brocialists," to all-out reactionaries.  
  
To deconstruct whiteness, the foremost step is to acknowledge its existence, and to recognize that marginalized people are being oppressed by the specter of whiteness and white supremacy.  
  
It is **crucial** that all Leftists do this (otherwise, there is nothing to separate you from the racists).  
  
It is also worth noting that what often ends up happening is that many confuse "racist" as an identity with "racist" as an adjective.  
  
You don't have to be in the KKK to be racist, and you don't have to love Hitler to do something fascist.  
  
If something you said shows prejudice against a racial/ethnic group, or blankets them as a whole, it's probably racist, even if you don't think of yourself that way.  
  
This same thing applies with fascism.  
  
If you think all criminals should be put to death, that's something a fascist might say and it's a fascist thing to say, but that doesn't mean you would join an American "Fascist Party."  
  
In general, a lot of people are extremely sensitive to criticism or the possibility of feeling misrepresented; we are are not different in that regard. We don't like being told that we call everyone we don't like racist; it just so happens that when people do racist things and we call them on it, they don't like it.  
  
If you genuinely don't want to be considered a racist or fascist, then you should listen when someone calls something you did racist or fascist (at the minimum). We can, for the most part, tell when someone is being unreasonable, but you have to at least hear others out, especially if you want them to trust you, be your friend, and/or stay your friend.
