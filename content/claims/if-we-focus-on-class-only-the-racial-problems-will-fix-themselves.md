This ignores some... let's say "questionable" policies by certain "socialist" governments in the past, like the relocation of the Tatars in the USSR, for example.  
  
It also ignores [Third Positionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Position) as a potential "socialist" position that addresses one thing, but not the other.  
  
So while nationalism and race can be understood as a construct used by the bourgeoisie to divide and control the proletariat, it historically has not been that simple.  
  
People carry in them biases that they are not aware of, which can lead to us taking a principle that we technically consider universal, but then manifest due to our biases as exclusionary (not just in matters of race).  
  
Kant's moral philosophy, for example, posits a type of universal ethics, but his racism led him to apply a different moral standard to people he considered "inferior."  
  
There is also the practical aspect of Capitalism.  
  
White Socialists must see how working to help their comrades of other colors who are doubly burdened under Capitalism benefits them. This is not to say that humans should see other humans as mere means to their own ends, but if white people are interested in the liberation of humanity as a whole, they must also be concerned about their own particular liberation in part.  
  
In short, Socialists should not simply assume that their policies and their "enlightened" worldview on the class struggle alone are infallible.
