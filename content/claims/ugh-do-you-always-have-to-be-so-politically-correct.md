Is the "politically correct" take something that you agree with deep down, but are too lazy to actually reflect in your own actions and/or words?  
  
We understand that we are all conditioned and therefore carrying with us negative ideas or perspectives rooted in our childhoods or traditions, but it is on all of us to actively work to be better people.  
  
Having some room to breathe and not overthink things is important, but if your words are reflecting negative ideas or sentiments, even though your intentions might not be in a bad place, it might be worth it to pause and reflect on what it is that you are promoting, and asking yourself if this is something that is in line with who you want to be as a human being.  
  
Integrity is important, and although none of us are perfect, we should strive to move with integrity (_this means making better decisions, even when no one is watching_).
