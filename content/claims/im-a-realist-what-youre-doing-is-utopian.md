[We strongly disagree](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch02.htm), but if what we are aiming to accomplish is merely "utopian" in your eyes (it's not in ours), that means you can at least see the good in it.  
  
You have one life; maybe help us create a new, "realistic" version of what we are aiming towards.  
  
If the problem is that it's not realistic, then join the discussion and help ground us. None of us here are dedicated to having our heads up our asses; we just want a better world than the one we are in.  
  
[This essay](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-are-we-good-enough) by Kropotkin makes several important points about "practical men" and their historical successes and relevance.
