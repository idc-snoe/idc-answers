Ahhh, [the great myth](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2015/06/the-origins-of-the-phrase-black-on-black-crime/395507/) of "Black-on-Black crime" is still with us.  
  
This one was conjured up through a twisting of statistics around concentrated poverty paired with residential segregation.  
  
The Atlanta Black Star cites a [2014 FBI report](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/expanded-homicide-data/expanded_homicide_data_table_6_murder_race_and_sex_of_vicitm_by_race_and_sex_of_offender_2014.xls) that shows us white Americans not only kill each other more _frequently_ than any other racial group in America, but that [there is only an eight percentage point margin between the rate at which Black Americans kill Black Americans, and the rate at which white people kill white people](http://atlantablackstar.com/2017/08/14/race-criminality-persistent-myth-black-black-crime/) (in 2014, a Black American was killed by a member of the same race 90 percent of the time while a white person was killed by a member of the same race 82 percent of the time).
