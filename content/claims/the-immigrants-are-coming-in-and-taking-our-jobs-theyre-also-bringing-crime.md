Immigrants largely work jobs that Americans no longer want to work, largely in the agriculture sector. Immigrants (undocumented and documented) also [pay into the tax system](http://taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/Media/Default/Documents/2015ARC/ARC15_Volume1_MSP_18_ITIN.pdf) in a [net gain for the U.S. treasury](https://itep.org/wp-content/uploads/ITEP-2017-Undocumented-Immigrants-State-and-Local-Contributions.pdf). Additionally, U.S. birthrates are low to the point we need immigrants to help fill the gap (see [here](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2017/08/30/immigrants-boost-americas-birth-rate) and [here](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2169119-the-us-isnt-fertile-enough-to-sustain-itself-without-immigrants/)).  
  
States with high levels of immigrants also see a LOWERING in crime rates. Immigrants (both documented and undocumented) commit fewer crimes than native born residents (see [here](https://www.cato.org/publications/immigration-research-policy-brief/criminal-immigrants-texas-illegal-immigrant) and [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1745-9125.12175)).
