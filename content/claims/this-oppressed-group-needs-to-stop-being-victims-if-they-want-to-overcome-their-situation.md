**1. This statement usually comes from a place of privilege.**

People who say this usually haven't had to endure the conditions and trauma placed on oppressed groups. It's easy for them to say they should just "suck it up" when they haven't experienced the same degree of oppression.



**2. It accomplishes nothing.**

"Stop playing the victim" isn't a policy. There's nothing actionable that we or even the oppressed group can act on. It's also ignores the many organizations and groups that have done the work and made specific and actionable policy recommendations for reparations that would have actual pragmatic success in improving the lives of marginalized groups.

3. It lets us write off past oppression/injustices.

Conditions imposed in the past have predictable outcomes that can last for generations. Saying "stop playing the victim" disregards these very real, generational effects on individuals and the group as a whole. History informs the present. If we don't address the history when making improvements now, how can we make reasonable improvements?



4. It ignores the current/ongoing oppression.

It’s not just oppression that happened in the past that's a problem. Oppression and injustices still occur to this day. Often these take the form of the generational effects of past injustices from which there were no reparations, or in some cases are outright continuations of past oppressions with different social characters (for example, with black Americans, the change in the character of oppression going from slavery to legalized segregation to the current system of mass incarceration, now referred to as the “New Jim Crow”).



For a Canadian example, Canada's colonial occupation of traditional Indigenous territories is an ongoing process of oppression with current actions/policies affecting these groups even to this day. Take the TC CGL pipeline and BC Supreme Court infringing on Wet'suwet'en land rights (and the many other ongoing land disputes), Indigenous foster care issues (said by some to be the new residential schools), missing Indigenous women and two-spirit people, low funding for reserves, lack of access to clean water for decades, the Indian Act (which still exists and pushes these colonial, dominating policies onto Indigenous peoples), and so on.



5. It tries to stuff an ideology of individualism into a systemic, structural problem.

We're not discounting an individual's ability to pursue opportunities, be strong and resilient, and overcome oppression and generational trauma, nor are we discounting individuals who have done so—that's great for them. What are we saying is that when people are placed under certain social and material conditions, those conditions can have predictable effects on peoples' individual choices. This means that to best address peoples' individual choices and get them to make "better" ones, we need to focus on improving those material conditions in order to ensure the best individual success for the most people.Conditions imposed in the past have predictable outcomes that can last for generations.
