title: "Why don't we talk about Black fatherlessness and what that does, or gun violence in Black communities?"

Black fatherlessness and gun violence are things that are absolutely talked about within America, but the biggest problem here is with regard to the diagnosis of why these issues are so prevalent and what the solutions are to fix them.  
  
The attack on the "Black family" and the scourge of gun violence can be traced to some clear material causes:  
  
1) The drug wars that disproportionately target Black communities.  
  
2) The continued perpetuation of systemic racism originating from slave labor and the capitalist need for a cheap and controllable labor source.
