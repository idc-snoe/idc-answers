Do you know any Black people personally?  
  
This question implies that all Black people are poor.  
  
Although there is a clear and major wealth gap, [we as Black Americans have a class system too](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/scf17.pdf), for the record (and have had one for quite some time).  
  
**We can respond to this question two reasonable ways:**  
  
1) Why do you think poor people just want "handouts" (as you call them)?  
  
2) Why are Black people disproportionately poor?  
  
Poor people, just like anyone else, deserve the basic necessities of life, and an opportunity to live a fruitful life. If someone is living in poverty, the fundamental reality is that they probably lacked the same opportunities that others were afforded, and for whatever reason find themselves in a destitute position; this does not mean that this position is deserved (there is no "level" playing field, and to state that people deserve poverty assumes that this is the case - it's also a pretty inhumane thing to posit, fam).  
  
With regard to Black poverty, maybe it has something to do with the whole slavery and segregation and systemic racism thing, but we wouldn't know about that, now would we.
