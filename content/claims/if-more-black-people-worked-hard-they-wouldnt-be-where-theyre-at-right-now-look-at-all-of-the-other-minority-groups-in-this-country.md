If we're not going to delve into the entire failure of Reconstruction to put Black people on anywhere near an equal footing in our society...  
  
The first thing we need to understand is the cost of credit, i.e., the interest rates on loans. Black people being systematically deprived from being lent to means that the community will have more difficulty building up wealth.  
  
The most recent is by not being privy to Federal Housing Association (FHA) loans in the post World War II economic boom, Black people were prevented from accumulating capital in home ownership. This has a cumulative effect on Black wealth; if I give you a dollar to invest that accumulates value over time, and I don't lend another person that same dollar, when I come calling for that dollar in the future, you will still have more money than the other person. Now spread this out by many thousands of times (and over decades), and you can understand why white net worth is nearly 10 times Black net worth in the U.S.  
  
Black communities being segregated and devalued by realtors meant that a Black-owned house was worth less, even if Black homeowners could get loans to build wealth.  
  
This is discussed by the scholar Mehrsa Baradaran in [The Color of Money](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674970953).  
  
It's worth looking at the history of Black-owned banks in the United States as well.  
  
Look at the Freedman's Bank, where Black people were accumulating deposits of capital that were wiped out by railroad speculation (done by white speculators who were managing this capital, not Black speculators!) and then not backed by the federal government. This collapse was wildly damaging to the trust the Black community had in banking in general for decades, further preventing Black citizens from building wealth, as they did not have access to credit that other groups could take advantage of (especially other immigrant groups that are highlighted by Baradaran's research in the 1900s in [this Intercepted podcast interview](https://theintercept.com/2017/10/11/intercepted-podcast-the-white-stuff/)).
