The Democratic Socials of Canada (DSC) first surfaced in January of 2020 amid a flurry of sponsored posts.

Little was known about the group until [Myka Conners discovered their suspicious posting history and investigated](https://medium.com/@mykaconners42069/joe-roberts-and-the-democratic-socialists-of-canada-1933dde561ca), appearing to expose Joe Roberts as the DSC "mastermind" and a Liberal party supporter who spent a career fighting for Zionist interests and high administrative costs for nonprofits with quotes like, "Why go work for $80k at a nonprofit when you could go work for JP Morgan Chase and make $500k? You’d be foolish."

[Briarpatch quickly picked up on the grift and Sophia Reuss penned a piece noting](https://briarpatchmagazine.com/articles/view/show-me-the-socialists), "Like the savviest of 21st-century marketing experts, Roberts and the founders of the DSC saw a problem and wanted to turn it into an opportunity. “The feeling is in the air that people are fed up with the NDP and the Liberals,” Conners says. “And \[Roberts] sees this – he does feel like a tech disruptor, this person who has an idea about how the market works and wants to come in and get credit for reinventing the wheel.”

It would appear the DSC has no close affiliation to labour - or any mutual aid organization committed to tackling the real issues working people face. It would appear the DSC is indeed a money-making scheme seeking whatever donation you can afford, without any transparency for where your dollar will go, or what concrete action it will achieve.

The DSC might best be summarized by how Conners closes their investigation into the group, "Joe Roberts is an American liberal Zionist settler with no place at the head of an organization claiming to be radical... He wants to be the CEO of Activism Inc. while collecting membership dues to produce anodyne videos featuring phrases like “Canada is a beautiful country.” He is a grifter looking for your donations. He is not your comrade."
