# PROTEST GUIDES

## GENERAL

[Anonymous - Survival Guide for Citizens in a Revolution](https://b-ok.cc/book/5395634/a85c69): This guide will give you some basic ideas and tips for how you and your friends/neighbors/family can stay safe in the violent turmoil around you. It is not a ready-made recipe, but it contains general
survival tactics and strategies.

[Do Not Show Up to Protests if You Don't Know Who the Organizers Are](https://twitter.com/SarahJama_/status/1266867302139658241): A Twitter thread illustrating why you shouldn't support protests with unclear leadership and what to do if you encounter one.

## MEDICAL

[New “Riot Medicine” Street Medic Manuel](https://itsgoingdown.org/announcing-new-riot-medicine-street-medic-manuel/): If you are an experienced medical professional, this book will guide you on how to safely operate during a protest. However, this book assumes that medicine may not be your primary occupation or ﬁeld of study. Both the common and more formal medical terms are included as well as a glossary for reference. Foundational medical theory has been provided to give context for various treatments, and as such, not all information in this book needs to be memorized.
