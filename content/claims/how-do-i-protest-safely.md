## MEDICAL

[New “Riot Medicine” Street Medic Manuel](https://itsgoingdown.org/announcing-new-riot-medicine-street-medic-manuel/): If you are an experienced medical professional, this book will guide you on how to safely operate during a protest. However, this book assumes that medicine may not be your primary occupation or ﬁeld of study. Both the common and more formal medical terms are included as well as a glossary for reference. Foundational medical theory has been provided to give context for various treatments, and as such, not all information in this book needs to be memorized.
