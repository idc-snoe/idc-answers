Boy, are you gonna be disappointed when you realize that Dairy Queen isn't actually a literal queen, or that the Philadelphia Flyers can't actually fly.  
  
We've also got some news for you about buffalo wings...  
  
Oh, and if the Nazis were Socialist, then Antifa must be anti-fascist, and certainly you don't support fascism, do you? You must support them based on the name alone, no?  
  
Okay, so here's the serious response...  
  
It is important to understand what the political climate of Germany was like in the 1920s, and why Hitler might have thought it wise to use the term "Socialism" (it's actually a trick that the fascists use a lot throughout history).  
  
Socialism was very popular in Germany before Hitler's rise to power (the [Spartacist Uprising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartacist_uprising) shows this).  
  
Hitler was not a fool; he used Socialism to get people on board.  
  
When Hitler came into power, things were getting bad economically. Hitler used this period as an opportunity to spread his form of "populism" (the fascists love fake populism). He even spoke in the language of the Left sometimes. He called himself a "National Socialist." This alone is a red flag (and not the good kind).  
  
**Socialism is international in nature.**  
  
However, it's not hard to see that actual Socialists were adamantly against Hitler at the time. The international Left in general was. It is no surprise that Hitler targeted the Left **first** when he came into power ([Martin Niemöller's First They Came](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came_...) poem is a contemporary account of this fact). Hitler wanted nothing to do with Socialism.  
  
If this is not enough to convince you, there are various speeches and [policy points you can look at that quite literally represent the antithesis of Socialism](http://www.ub.edu/graap/nazi.pdf).  
  
So who benefited from Hitler's rise to power? Was it the people? Or Capitalists who received billions of dollars to build a war machine?  
  
Hitler (who was Nazism personified for Nazis) was a fan of eugenics, social darwinism, and was hostile to both unionism and Communism. He went about privatizing as much as he could and gave Capitalism whatever it needed as long as it was serving the fascist state. **That is not Socialism**.  
  
"First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—  
Because I was not a Socialist.  
Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—  
Because I was not a trade unionist.  
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—  
Because I was not a Jew.  
Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me."  
  
When Socialism comes, we can tell you who it will benefit:  
  
**The people.**
