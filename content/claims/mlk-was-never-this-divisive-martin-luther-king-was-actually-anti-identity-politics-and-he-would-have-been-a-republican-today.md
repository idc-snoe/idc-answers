MLK was literally murdered for his politics. [He was also critical of the capitalist system starting in his 20s](http://inthesetimes.com/article/20839/martin-luther-king-jr-day-socialism-capitalism), so he would not be a Republican today.  
  
[MLK did not belong to or identify with either major political party, and at times called out both parties for having failed and betrayed Black Americans. His father was a Republican prior to the Civil Rights Movement, as were many Black Americans, for this was during a time when the Republican Party was seen as the Party of Lincoln.](https://www.cnn.com/2016/01/15/us/mlk-myths/index.html)  
  
Political parties have changed their values significantly over the course of American history, to the point that the current Republican Party bares little resemblance to the Republican Party during the time of Lincoln.
