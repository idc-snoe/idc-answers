Racism is not as simple as "hating all black people."  
  
It's more accurate to say that racism is when one views one race as "innocent until proven guilty," and another as "guilty until proven innocent."  
  
The fact that someone has black friends doesn't say much, because it could be a case of "innocent until proven guilty," but it could also be a case of "guilty until proven innocent."  
  
Whether or not someone has black friends doesn't really say anything one way or another.  
  
The root of casual racism in America that we all observe isn't usually outright hatred, but ignorance of the historical injustices against Black Americans, of the modern continuations of these injustices, and of the many ways that Black Americans have been left at a disadvantage over time.  
  
Lots of people hold no hatred for Black people, but as white Americans have been socialized in a society suffused with racist messages and acceptance of inequity, virtually all white Americans unknowingly hold many racist attitudes.  
  
This doesn't make all white people "bad" people; it is just what their upbringings have made them (how they are shaped by their environments).  
  
This, however, does mean that white people have an obligation to listen to Black voices, and to carefully examine the beliefs they have received when they learn that they have racist origins.
