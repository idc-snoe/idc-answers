And European settlers "belonged" in Europe by your logic. But guess what?  
  
They colonized America, killed off a majority of the Indigenous population, enslaved our ancestors, designed systems that have us disproportionately enslaved today, and now their descendants think that the land has always been their own.  
  
Oh, and if someone is born and raised in a particular region of the world, then they are _from_ said region of the world.  
  
Oh, and humans have been migrating for most of their history, by the way.
