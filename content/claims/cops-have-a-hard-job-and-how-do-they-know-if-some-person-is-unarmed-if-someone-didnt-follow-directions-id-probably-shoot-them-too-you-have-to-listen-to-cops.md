title: "Cops have a hard job, and how do they know if some person is unarmed? If someone didn't follow directions, I'd probably shoot them too. You have to listen to cops."

[Policing institutions have their roots in slave patrols, so just keep that in mind when you tell Black people that they "have to listen to cops](https://plsonline.eku.edu/insidelook/brief-history-slavery-and-origins-american-policing)."  
  
Cops may have a difficult job, but what seems more relevant is how dangerous it is (or isn't).  
  
Policing is not actually as dangerous in terms of fatalities per worker as numerous other jobs, including construction, logging, fishing, and agriculture. A lot of the cop fatalities we hear about are just car accidents and have nothing to do with intentional harm. Now, maybe certain kinds of cops skew those statistics in one direction or another, so let's grant for the sake of argument that some cops are routinely in extraordinary danger from potentially armed assailants.  
  
Even if that were the case, that still shouldn't be license to murder someone for, say, pulling their pants up contrary to instructions.  
  
If YOU (someone who isn't a cop) shot someone simply for "not following directions", there is a very large chance that you would be convicted of murder or manslaughter, as that is obviously insufficient justification for using lethal force.  
  
It's also not illegal to carry a firearm, and it certainly is not illegal to be suspected of possibly having a weapon. Cops are clearly capable of refraining from shooting people who they KNOW have a gun (consider how many mass shooters are arrested rather than killed). The mass shooters who are arrested mostly happen to be white, too, which doesn't seem like a coincidence.  
  
Or consider the Bundy standoff: a confrontation between around twenty armed ranchers and the bureau of land management that lasted several weeks and in which the ranchers had pointed weapons directly at the police; not even one single death resulted. These were people who the police KNEW were armed and could shoot them with a simple pull of the trigger and yet still, they didn't shoot them.  
  
How often have you been stopped by a cop with a drawn weapon barking instructions at you? Has it even happened once? For people in some communities, this is a frequent occurrence. Do you really think a life should end because on the fiftieth time someone was harassed by a cop, they didn't put their hands in the right place fast enough?  
  
Shooting someone for not following directions is putting a cop's convenience above the life of those they are supposedly sworn to "serve" and "protect" (we know this is not actually the role of the police historically). Now, sure, a standoff is a high pressure situation for a cop. And if it's a high pressure situation for a cop, it's that much higher for the one who has a gun pointed at them, especially considering how trigger-happy cops seem to be. Too often cops will unnecessarily escalate situations into such standoffs.  
  
Putting aside whether or not there should even be cops in the first place (there shouldn't be cops, by the way), maybe people who aren't really prepared to put their own life on the line, and who shoot people who aren't obviously a threat on the pretext that they are "afraid for their lif," shouldn't actually be cops. And maybe they should figure this out before they KILL SOMEONE. And maybe those who are dismissed because they killed someone in such a fashion shouldn't be hired to do police work in the next county over.  
  
You can argue that cops sometimes have a reason to use lethal force. But we constantly see cases where they use it without having sufficient justification and someone ends up dead. And it disproportionately happens to Black people because they are disproportionately targeted for various reasons, including where they live, implicit bias, spurious 911 calls, and simple, intentional profiling.  
  
It's easy to say that you have to follow a cop's directions if you're not regularly on the receiving end of such directions. If you are, have you always managed to perfectly comply, and can you really expect that of someone every time? What if the directions aren't even consistent, as has certainly happened before? If you're not regularly on the receiving end of such directions, maybe consider how your opinion might change if you were, because there are people for whom that is reality, and their lives matter just as much as yours.
