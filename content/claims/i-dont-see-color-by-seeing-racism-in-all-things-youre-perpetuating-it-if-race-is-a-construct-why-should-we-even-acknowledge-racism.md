Recognizing race as a social construct does not make race less "real."  
  
Money is a social construct, but you wouldn't burn your wallet, right?  
  
Scientists generally do not recognize "race" as biologically meaningful, but race is socially real, not biologically real.  
  
Race as a social construct is contingent on social groups and their collective agreement and acceptance of the constructions.  
  
Race is something that is real in society, and that shapes the way we see ourselves and others. It marks status that includes or excludes others from broader social constructs and enables or disables certain powers.  
  
Race indicators are collectively imposed and defined by the dominant group to indicate what status you have in society. People do not realize that they may not be explicitly endorsing racism while tacitly accepting racist ideology and promoting racism by way of reaping the benefits coffered to them. As such, race has real consequences and effects on laws, institutions, structural inequality, health, etc.  
  
Ignoring race is ineffective and harmful in dealing with social, structural, and institutional issues.
