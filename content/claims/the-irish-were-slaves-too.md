Were the Irish ever slaves (period)?  
  
Yes, in the sense that people in what is now the Republic of Ireland enslaved each other and were abducted for forced labor by other peoples.  
  
Were the Irish ever slaves during the period the Atlantic slave trade provided labor to the United States of America and the colonies that became that country?  
  
No.  
  
"Slave" is a term with incredibly varied meaning depending on the locality and period. Conveniently, colonial and early U.S. documents leave a body of law collectively called "Slave Codes" that as a whole give a fairly clear legal definition of slavery. A slave was any black person, or less often an "American Indian," who was property by virtue of either legal sale, or who received the status of slave by being born to a slave. Persons were considered "black" if they had any provable African ancestry, and in most states only the children of female slaves were automatically slaves.  
  
There was a significant population of Irish people who immigrated under indenture. This is legally distinct from the chattel slavery discussed above, though it is another form of forced labor. Indenture is a form of labor equity in which a person promises their labor for a specific period of time in exchange for something else of value, such as an education in a trade, or in this case transatlantic passage. The indentured person would not only be required to labor for the period of indenture, but also have their mobility and legal rights restricted by the person holding their indenture. They could not travel, marry, or make other legal contracts without the permission of the indenture holder. Someone who paid for passage across the Atlantic through indenture was undertaking a legal status similar to an apprentice in a contemporary guild, who promised their labor for a set period in return for education in a craft and eventual recognition as a journeyman.  
  
The important distinction here is that while both indentured servitude and chattel slavery are forms of forced labor, a person under indenture was still legally a person. They had the same protections and rights under the law as any other person, other than those specifically superseded by the rights of the indenture holder. Any child they bore would be free, barring a choice to sell their indenture. A slave, meanwhile, is not considered (and treated as) a person. Their only legal presence is in a proof of purchase, similar to livestock. A slave could not marry any more than a plow horse could marry, and any children a slave might bear would also be slaves.  
  
When discussing the Irish there is one form of indenture that is especially notable: convict indenture.  
  
The British government sent numerous political and non-political prisoners to their colonies in North America and especially the Caribbean. A significant number of these individuals would have been Irish. While these people had significantly less choice in the matter, legally they were still serving an indenture, rather than slaves.  
  
They were legally still people and, after serving their specific period, they would be free.  
  
Indenture fell off drastically after the American Revolution. The nascent United States was not an attractive place for foreign business ventures, and so while immigration continued there was significantly less capital to invest, and less faith that the terms of indenture would be enforced. Slavery, meanwhile, was the backbone of much of the new country's economy, and would continue well after the 1807 Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves.  
  
Forced labor is forced labor, but it is dishonest to compare the exploitation of the Irish and other poor immigrants faced during the USA's founding and early growth with the atrocities committed against Black and Indigenous/Native people during this same period.  
  
The Irish in America were often mistreated, but they were always legally people.  
  
For much of our history, Africans were not.
