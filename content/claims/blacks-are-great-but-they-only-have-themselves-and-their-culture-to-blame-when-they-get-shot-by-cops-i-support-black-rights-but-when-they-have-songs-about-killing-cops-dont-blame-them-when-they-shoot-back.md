Policing was anti-Black long before rap music was invented.  
  
The roots of modern policing exist not in town watches, as is often claimed, but in slave patrols.  
  
Town watches were always members of the community they patrolled with little-to-no special authority; they simply shared the responsibility of their community's safety as part of living in that community.  
  
Slave patrollers, meanwhile, were usually either paid a wage or more often a bounty for returned slaves, and had additional legal authorities beyond a normal citizen. When the Compromise of 1850 forced Fugitive Slave Laws on free states, slave patrollers gained even freedom to operate, as these laws not only criminalized aiding slaves, but also allowed them to kidnap and enslave any Black person anywhere in the country with only a signed affidavit from the alleged owner.  
  
**Abolition did not significantly slow police abuse of people of color.**  
  
During Reconstruction, the need for non-farm labor that had previously been met by slaves was instead met by convict labor, almost exclusively recently freed Black people arrested for violating the new "Black Codes."  
  
The penal labor exemption of the Thirteenth Amendment allowed a system where forced labor of people of colors could be continued almost uninterrupted after emancipation (this is why we say slavery technically never ended). This system has lived on into the present day, and the rise of for-profit prisons, with contracts that often stipulate a minimum number of filled beds, has arguably escalated the exploitation of the most legally vulnerable members of communities: Black and brown Americans.
