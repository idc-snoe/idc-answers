[Maybe you not having to deal with trouble from cops has less to do with being "polite" and "following orders," and more to do with not being Black](https://eji.org/racial-justice/presumption-guilt). Either way, your rationale is purely [anecdotal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anecdotal_evidence).
