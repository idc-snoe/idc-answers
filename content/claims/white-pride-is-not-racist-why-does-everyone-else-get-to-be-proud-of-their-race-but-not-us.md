"White" isn't a nationality, let alone an ethnic category - it is an extremely broad grouping based strictly upon skin color and other physical features, and a grouping so broad that one is basically saying that they are proud to not be an ethnic minority in saying that they are "proud to be white."  
  
There is no culture of "whiteness."  
  
You cannot conflate the achievements of the Scandinavians with those of the Italians, and the achievements of the Italians with those of the British, and so on and so forth.  
  
"Whiteness" isn't pro-anything.  
  
It is anti-non-white.  
  
To be proud of being Black (uppercase "B"), in America, is different because most Black Americans (not African Americans who are first, second, or third generation immigrants) can't trace their roots back to their most direct ancestors in Africa. Many of us can't even be sure what part of Africa we come from, and can't localize our genealogical heritage. It just so happens that our common bond is directly related to the color of our skin due to the harsh oppression of our ancestors under chattel slavery for centuries in the New World.
