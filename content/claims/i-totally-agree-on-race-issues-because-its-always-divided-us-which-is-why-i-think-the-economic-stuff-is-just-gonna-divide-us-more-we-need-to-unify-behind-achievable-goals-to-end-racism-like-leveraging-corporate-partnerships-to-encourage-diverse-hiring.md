title: "I totally agree on race issues, because it's always divided us, which is why I think the economic stuff is just gonna divide us more. We need to unify behind achievable goals to end racism like leveraging corporate partnerships to encourage diverse hiring!"

You are one step away from understanding the underlying cause of oppression, Capitalism.  
  
The underlying assumption of a race-only solution is that when racial groups are forced together (through law and regulation), they will work out their differences, i.e. the "melting pot." The antebellum South in the U.S. or apartheid South Africa are examples of intense, daily contact and deep familiarity between dominant and dominated individuals, where contact didn't diminish prejudice. Increased intergroup contact only works if the persons concerned are equal in status, have common goals, are not in competition, and if the contact is sanctioned by authority (Pettigrew, T. F., & Tropp, L. R. (2006). _A meta-analytic test of intergroup contact theory. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology_, 90(5), 751-783.).  
  
Also, the outgroup suffers significant adverse effects during this process. Among many other issues, minorities and immigrants throughout the world suffer from worse health than host or majority populations and this problem has been observed in virtually all modern industrial societies. Part of this disparity is economic, but stress has been recognized as the crucial causal link between discrimination and health. The psychological and physical negative effects on the outgroup are significant. An exception to this rule is the "ethnic density" effect in which minorities and immigrants who live among members of their group are healthier than those who live among the majority population. Scientists have suggested that due to density, individuals have more and better social ties in homogeneous places and/or that ethnic density provides "buffering" against the social-psychological effects of discrimination (Boyer P., Firat R., van Leeuwen F., _Perspectives in Psychological Science_, 2015).  
  
Employment and education quotas alone as an attempt to increase contact with outgroups to solve racial issues is impractical and immoral. The cost of assimilation to the culture, identity, psychology, and health of the outgroup is significant. Under Capitalism, education and employment are competitive and stratified while diminishing prejudice only happens with equal status and no competition.  
  
The goals of Capitalism and equality are incompatible. Race can only be addressed if "economic stuff" is addressed.
