Explicit racism was sanctioned by the Canadian government until 1960. The Bill of Rights established in that year was [the first federal bill](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-12.3/page-1.html) to make it illegal for schools, employers, labour unions, and landlords to racially discriminate after the Supreme Court of Canada [declared racial discrimination legal in 1939](https://www.crrf-fcrr.ca/images/stories/pdf/ePubFaShLegRac.pdf). The historical recency of this racist policy is a key motivator of racial inequality across Canada.

[Indigenous people have an unemployment rate 2.1 times higher than other Canadians, a median income of less than two-thirds the national average, an incarceration rate 10 times higher than the national rate, and a dropout rate of 23%.](https://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/CHARTS_MAC04-Gilmore.jpeg) Many of these numbers are so dire because of the de facto segregation caused by the Indian Act and the remoteness of many reserves, which prevents Indigenous people from building connections in urban centres –where employment or education opportunities may be better– without leaving their community. None of this is to mention the national crisis of [missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48503545), or Canada’s grim history of "[starlight tours](https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/supporting_resources/canada_saskatchewan_submission_june_2017.pdf)." A practice in which police abandoned intoxicated Indigenous people outside city limits on freezing cold nights to die from exposure.

Despite Black Canadians being [more likely to achieve post-secondary education](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/89-657-x/89-657-x2020002-eng.htm) than white Canadians,  overrepresentation in precarious job markets and underfunding of family-oriented social services has caused a staggering [44% of Black children to live in poverty](https://minorityrights.org/minorities/african-and-caribbean-canadians/), compared to the [U.S.’s 33%](http://www.nccp.org/media/releases/release_34.html).

Canada practiced outright slavery until the early 1800s, but de facto slavery continued long after. Chinese immigrants working on the Pacific Railway in the 1880s were paid [barely enough to cover what the railway charged for room and board](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/multiculturalism-anti-racism/chinese-legacy-bc/history/building-the-railway), trapping them in a debt cycle of perpetual servitude. Japanese Canadians were [put into internment camps from 1941-49](https://humanrights.ca/story/japanese-canadian-internment-and-the-struggle-for-redress#:~:text=Approximately%2012%2C000%20people%20were%20forced,of%20war%20camps%20in%20Ontario.), their homes and business were repossessed by the state, and they were forced into slave labour as “prisoners of war.”

Prison labour in Canada lives on today, inmates earn a maximum of $6.90 per day before deductions, [often amounting to as little as $1.95](https://business.financialpost.com/news/court-challenge-to-inmate-pay-places-prison-labour-program-in-the-crosshairs). When people of colour are as overrepresented in the judicial system as they are ([Black Canadians are incarcerated at a rate 300% higher than they should be based on population, and Indigenous people at nearly 500%](https://johnhoward.ca/blog/race-crime-justice-canada/)) it becomes very difficult to tell ourselves this is not a continuation of the slavery that established this country. 

This thinly veiled subjugation of people of colour is generally the main thrust of the argument that the treatment of minorities is better in Canada than in the U.S. Since Canada has made an attempt to hide its racist intentions, those arguing in bad faith, or denying their position out of guilt, can choose to not see past this façade. A veneer of politeness does not make our material condition better, it just makes it harder to argue against, but armed with proper information this myth is easily dispelled.
