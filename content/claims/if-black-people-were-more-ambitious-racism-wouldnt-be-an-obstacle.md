Before the recession, two-thirds of Americans surveyed said that the "American Dream" was harder to achieve. After the recession, even more Americans realized that not only was the "dream" unattainable, but that it was a myth.  
  
In _The Meritocracy Myth_, sociologists McNamee and Miller posited that while merit on economic outcomes is vastly overestimated, non-merit factors can suppress or negate efforts. Joseph Eugene Stiglitz, an American economist, said that the U.S. has one of the highest levels of income inequality among its peers and the worst in offering equal opportunities for advancement (Luhby).  
  
The White House Task Force on the Middle Class reported, "It is more difficult now than in the past for many people to achieve middle-class status because prices for certain key goods — health care, college, and housing — have gone up faster than income" (it is worth noting, by the way, that the term "middle class" is misleading; there is the working class, and the capitalist class; there are those that must sell their labor power to survive, and those who live "free" through the exploitation of others).  
  
The U.S. has lower rates of income mobility than other developed countries such as France, Germany, Sweden, Canada, Finland, Norway, and Denmark. A glut of evidence has led researchers to conclude that the idea of America as the "land of opportunity" is misplaced.  
  
If Black Americans do in fact lack ambition, then white Americans are finally starting to realize what Black Americans have known all along.
