You didn't cross the Delaware river either.  
  
You didn't fight against the British in the Revolutionary War and you didn't free the slaves, yet despite all that, we'd bet you're proud to be an "American."  
  
If you're going to take pride in your ancestors' accomplishments, it's hypocritical to not take responsibility for their crimes.  
  
Furthermore, you also directly benefit from the things your ancestors have done. In the same way that your grandparents being rich has an effect on your life, even if you don't feel personally responsible, the racism of your ancestors has directly benefited you in ways you cannot deny or fathom without some reflection.  
  
There is a difference between accepting guilt and accepting responsibility.  
  
Upon hearing about a friend or family member being injured by a stranger, a reasonable person would not angrily respond that they should be left alone since they had nothing to do with it.  
  
A person should also feel comfortable asking for help without worrying about the request seeming like an accusation.  
  
Everything that we do, or do not do, has an impact on the world around us. Most of us have an implicit understanding of our relationship with people we will never meet, but it is easier to go about our lives with the illusion of a great divide between us. We all have a responsibility to acknowledge how we are connected, and to engage with the world in a way that makes it better.  
  
The simple passage of time will not allow our societal wounds to heal, no matter how determined we are to convince ourselves that we are not involved. Apathy or denial might manifest from a feeling of helplessness about what we can do to help the people around us.  
  
There is nothing wrong with uncertainty, as long we are willing to address it in a meaningful way. The most important part of our relationship with humanity is to make ourselves accountable to each other. Millions of people are asking their neighbors for help, and we have a responsibility to listen to them.
