Not only is there not any real unitary "white" history, but there is something to be said here about the utility of history (as a subject in schools, for example).  
  
There is a common assumption that only the history of one's own culture should be taught, perhaps with a little international "stuff" stacked on top that either does not take into account what can be learned from the history of other cultures, or simply assumes one's own culture is the most important.  
  
Furthermore, "white" history is and always has been erased by the white and powerful people for their (the white **and** powerful) own benefit (from the way we gloss over all of the atrocities of Columbus, to the way we glorify the old royalty).  
  
The only people who have erased white history are those who intend to control you.  
  
"White" history for long stretches of time was just about white-washing the accomplishments of people of color, or claiming that said people of color were "white" themselves (from the invention of the lens, to basic physics, etc.).  
  
You can see it in the common depictions of Jesus, the Egyptians, or the Greeks.  
  
"White" people have always tried to associate anything good produced in the world with "white" people and their "effort" in order to feed into the false racial concept of meritocracy.  
  
"White" (European) heritage is being erased by all of the people refusing to look at the mistakes Europeans have made, and erasing the lessons all can learn from them.  
  
If you want to talk about "white" history being erased, perhaps it would be worth saying something about how our educational institutions don't tell us exactly how many people were in favor of lynching during its peak in popularity within America, so that you have historical context.  
  
If you don't want "white" history erased, perhaps it would be worth fighting to ensure that Europeans aren't homogenized into crude categories like "white" by encouraging others to read about the racial hierarchies that existed in the Spanish colonies and how they inform the racism of today.  
  
One should use this knowledge to understand that someone in power will always come up with a reason for you to hate your neighbor so they can oppress you both. Racism at large is just divisive, and to let the racists purify your "white" history so people with white skin seem "superior" just makes us forget the errors that "white" people have been a part of and continue to perpetuate.
