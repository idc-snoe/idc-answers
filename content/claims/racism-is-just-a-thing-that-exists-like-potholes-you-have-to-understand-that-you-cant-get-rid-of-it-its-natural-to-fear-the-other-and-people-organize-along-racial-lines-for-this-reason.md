Do you recommend we just live with potholes, or should we fix them?  
  
Who defines the "other" and how do they define it? And why is it considered "natural" to "fear" those who are different? Perhaps the solution is making it so that there is no fear between different people, and bringing people together both socially and economically.  
  
People organize around "racial" lines in America because of the racialized institutions in our society, as well as their colonialist, white supremacist roots. This must be challenged.
