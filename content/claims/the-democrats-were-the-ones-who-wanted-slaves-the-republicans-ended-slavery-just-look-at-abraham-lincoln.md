It is true that the **name** of the slave-owning political party was the Democratic Party. After the Civil War, that party continued its exploitation of the former slaves through the Jim Crow system. The former slave owners made up the southern wing of the Democratic Party. Starting approximately after WWII, the more "liberal" parts of the Democratic Party began to push for social reform, including racial reform. The southern Democrats were absolutely opposed to any reform. As early as 1948, some Democrats began to split off. Strom Thurmond, for example, left the party and became a "Dixiecrat."  
  
The racial reform picked up steam with Brown v. Board of Education. Eisenhower sent in federal troops to integrate schools in Arkansas. Then Kennedy pushed for civil rights reform. The real disaster for the southern Democrats happened when Johnson got the 1964 Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act passed. In 1968, the Republicans realized they could take the entire southern Democratic vote by using the "Southern Strategy." They began using racist dog whistles and other political strategies to appeal to southern whites. The national Republican Party then became the new "Jim Crow" Democratic Party.  
  
The southern strategy worked spectacularly well. "Democrat" became a slur word. The name "Democratic Party" remained the same; the former southern Jim Crow Democrats changed their name to "Republican." Only the name changed; the political beliefs remained the same.  
  
The progressive, Liberal Republicans of 1860 ended slavery. The old conservative, reactionary, and racist Democrats of 1860 wanted to keep slavery.  
  
Now we could be super petty and bring up how the Republican Party back then was filled to the brim with Socialists, Communists, and Anarchists... you know, mention folks like [August Willich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Willich) (who even challenged Marx to a gun duel because he thought Marx was too conservative), [Joseph Weydemeyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weydemeyer), and others. We could even talk about how [Marx wrote letters in support of Lincoln's fight against slavery](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/iwma/documents/1864/lincoln-letter.htm).  
  
Would the modern day Republicans support such "radicals"? If they do not, then it is clear that they do not support the "radical" ideals that the Republican Party was, at one point, representative of, and thus have little right to claim Lincoln for themselves.  
  
The short response to this statement is really that we are so far removed from the traditional identities of the two major parties that this talking point is moot.
