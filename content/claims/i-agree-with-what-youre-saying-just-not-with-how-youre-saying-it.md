This is called [tone policing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_policing).  
  
This implies that rhetoric matters more to you than actual ideas.  
  
There is a time for a discussion of optics, but this is not usually appropriate over matters dealing with race and/or class.  
  
One should judge ideas based off of what they are, not by how they are presented, although presentation and clarity play a significant role in our communications.  
  
Obviously saying "white people are racist" (for example) is so simplistic that it's almost useless, but if one knows how to read these statements and the intent behind them, then there is no problem in most cases. A majority of people, however, lack the understanding to read these kinds of statements correctly.  
  
Tone policing isn't the solution to this problem, and neither is telling people to educate themselves.  
  
People are always going to be reactionary and interpret statements according to how they make them feel. It's up to us collectively to educate people over time, and with patience.
