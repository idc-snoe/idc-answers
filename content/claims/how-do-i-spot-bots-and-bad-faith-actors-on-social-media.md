Here's some tips on spotting bots:

[How to Spot a Twitter Bot](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/election-security/spot-twitter-bot)
- Many Twitter bots have a relatively recent creation date.
- Many bot user names contain numbers, which can indicate automatic name generation.
- The account primarily retweets content, rather than tweeting original content.
- The account’s tweet frequency is higher than a human user could feasibly achieve.
- The account may have a high number of followers and also be following a lot of accounts; conversely, some bot accounts are identifiable because they send a lot of tweets but only have a few followers.

In addition to bots, watch out for bad faith actors who are frequently employees or volunteers with organizations that intentionally create division and arguments to waste your time and prevent communities from uniting.

- Do not offer sources or what sources would convince them. See: Flat-earthers.
- Creates strawman arguments, assuming your position and arguing against that - not what you're actually saying.
- Acts as a lie detector, accuses you of lying when contradicted
- Acts as a fake free speech advocate. They confuse disagreement with silencing, delegitimization, and censorship. See: Jordan Peterson on Transgender pronouns
- Purity testers don't tell you a policy agenda is wrong; they’re here to tell you those are bad spokespeople for their cause. See: AOC wearing nice clothes means she can't care about the poor.
