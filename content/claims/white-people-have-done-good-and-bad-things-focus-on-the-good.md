The "bad" (all across the board and for all peoples) has long-term institutional consequences that need to be addressed; only focusing on the "good" won't help those issues get solved.  
  
Critical thinking and analyses matter, and we're particularly focused on critical analysis that is constructive; we are seeking and acting upon **solutions**.
