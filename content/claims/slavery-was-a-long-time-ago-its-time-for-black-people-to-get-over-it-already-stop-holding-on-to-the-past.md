**First of all, the year is 2020 and "slavery" is still ongoing.**  
  
Check out the [13th Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiii):  
  
_Amendment XIII  
Section 1.  
Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.  
  
Section 2.  
Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation._  
  
Take note of this phrase: "... **except as a punishment for crime**..."  
  
Slavery is still legal and still occurs in the U.S. so long as it is punishment for a crime.  
  
Now chattel slavery (which is what you're referring to) went on for centuries.  
  
Due to Union measures such as the Confiscation Acts and Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, the war effectively ended slavery, even before ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment in **December of 1865** formally ended the legal institution throughout the United States.  
  
1865 is not a long time ago whatsoever. If you don't believe us, [check this out](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/08/putting-time-in-perspective.html) when you have a second.  
  
The Civil Rights Movement was only 60 years ago.  
  
Your grandparents were probably old enough to have been students protesting the desegregation of their schools.  
  
Up until the passing of the CRA, we were literally considered second-class citizens.  
  
Racism has been a thing your entire life, and it didn't just disappear with the CRA. In fact, right after the CRA passed, and just before, there were huge race riots.  
  
We don't want to have the effects of slavery still weighing on us, but until the effects are gone, we must bring them up.
