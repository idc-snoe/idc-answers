Ignoring the problematic media portrayal of gulags, \[capitalist countries had mastered concentration camps long before soviet gulags](https://jacobinmag.com/2017/05/uk-concentration-camps-wwii-poland-internment-prisoners).

Over 20,000 children died of starvation and diseash in British concentration camps during the second Boer War (1899-1902) alone and thousands more suffered in compounds like the Lancaster Concentration Camp which saw Germain civilians be attacked with a bayonet charge to restore order.

Even today, [for-profit prison systems in capitalist countries effectively enslave large portions of the population](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2017/09/slavery-prison-system-170901082522072.html) while exploiting their labor for as little as 23 cents an hour while producing items like produce for Walmart, uniforms for McDonald's, and missiles for Lockheed Martin. It's no wonder that prison-labour is now a billion-dollar industry [where defendents in regions with private prisons can expect to be sentenced to three aditional months in prison, with lower quality rehablitative care which makes them less likely to get out early for good behavior](https://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty_pages/christian.dippel/privateprisons_sentencing.pdf).

Gulags as they're portrayed in popular media are certainly terrible, but the capitalist system has normalized and monetized the enslavement of the most vulnerable elements of our society with no end in sight.
