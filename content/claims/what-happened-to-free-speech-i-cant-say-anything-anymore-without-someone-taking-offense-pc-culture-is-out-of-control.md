What happened to free speech in the context of "PC culture" is, at its core, dishonest.  
  
The "free speech" argument displays a political spin of the group that has its hands on it.  
  
It is used as a political tool rather than a concept to keep the combatants in the political arena honest.  
  
There are no official rules, guidelines, or laws in favor of political correctness and against offensive speech.  
  
If proponents of offensive speech were honest, they would admit that what distresses them is not that they can't speak, but that they don't wish to hear what others have to say, particularly in response to their own speech.  
  
And political correctness is not a paradox.  
  
If one believes that the proliferation of speech in the long run will do society more good than harm, then the point and effect of political correctness is to lift the voices and maximize the speech opportunities and hereto suppressed speech of groups with less status so that all groups are considered to have equal merit and a seat at the table.
