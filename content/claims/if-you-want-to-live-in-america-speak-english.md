If your ancestors wanted to live in America, maybe they should have learned some Indigenous/Native American languages (as well as some other things).  
  
_Okay, in all seriousness..._  
  
The demand for immigrants to speak English is an ethnocentric mandate for cultural assimilation into a system of multicultural intolerance (translation: this is a self-centered, selfish, and narcissistic demand to make, and it doesn't sit on fair, even grounds).  
  
The idea that penniless immigrants once came to this country and worked low-paying jobs to pull themselves up by their bootstraps to eventually reach equality of skills and income with "natives" is mostly false.  
  
During the Age of Mass Migration, long-term immigrants and natives held jobs at similar skill levels and climbed the occupational ladder at comparatively the same rate. Regardless of where they started, the gaps between immigrants and natives persisted throughout their lives. However, among the discrepancies of second generation citizens, children with less-foreign-sounding names who completed more years of schooling earned more, and were less likely to be unemployed as compared to their counterparts whose names sounded more foreign.  
  
It is likely that their foreign-sounding names exposed them to discrimination at school or on the job (see [here](https://publicpolicy.stanford.edu/news/what-history-tells-us-about-assimilation-immigrants)). It hasn't been a lack of English language proficiency or assimilation that stalled upward mobility; the issue is that immigrants have been confronted with ethnocentrism and a socioeconomic system (Capitalism) in which upward mobility is a myth.  
  
Contrary to popular belief, America doesn't have an official language. America also has more native Spanish speakers than Spain itself. Not to mention most countries in the EU, Asia, and even Africa speak more than one language. Among the "developed" world, we are one of the only ones who speak only one language primarily. If anything, we should all be learning to use Spanish too, or French, and require it for the workplace as well as through high school.  
  
Studies show that bilingual children are better at problem-solving and creative tasks on average. America only stands to gain more by becoming multilingual.  
  
Not to mention there are plenty of dialects of other languages that are only spoken here! For example, Texan German is a thing because of migrants passing it down through generations. Louisiana French is another example of a language only spoken here. And at some point, it will be the same way for Spanish. That's not even counting AAVE (Black American English in all of its forms).  
  
We should **embrace** language diversity.
