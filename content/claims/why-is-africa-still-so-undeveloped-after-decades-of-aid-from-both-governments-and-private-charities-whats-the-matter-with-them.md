Certainly you aren't trying to imply that there is something inherent about black people that makes them predisposed to failure.  
  
You just answered your own question.  
  
Under a capitalist system, the incentive for any nation-state (and most private interests) isn't to "help" African nations become "developed" for the benefit of Africans, but rather for the benefit of corporations (and more broadly, the global capitalist class) so that they may be in a better position to exploit the resources that Africa has to offer.  
  
["Aid" in a capitalist system is not used to help people primarily, but as a bargaining tool to enable or support resource and labor exploitation.](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/jan/14/aid-in-reverse-how-poor-countries-develop-rich-countries)  
  
Despite "aid" from western countries, the amount of money flowing out of Africa to the West still dwarfs the amount coming in. This is due to regressive trade laws that mean that poor countries are required to open their markets to foreign goods (dumping).  
  
Since the mid 20th century, many African leaders who attempted to end this and develop their countries in the same way that western countries had (tax and spend, build public industry and services, etc.) have been couped and assassinated, mostly with help from the French, United Kingdom, and United States. (Sankara, Lumumba, Nkrumah, etc.).  
  
Yes there are corrupt people in those countries at the top, and this does not contradict the imperialism hypothesis, as they are required by the richer countries to make the money flow.
