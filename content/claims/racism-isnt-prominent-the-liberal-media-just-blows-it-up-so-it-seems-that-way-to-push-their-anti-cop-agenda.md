You already know what we're gonna say about the racism thing (come on, we all have social media and smartphones, so if you want to see racism in action today, just head on over to YouTube or Twitter and do a simple search), but let's address the Liberal media thing, because we don't really like Liberal or Conservative media very much (and that's putting it lightly).  
  
The relationships between institutions such as the mainstream media and police must be understood in the larger context of Capitalism as a class-based economic system that benefits from and contributes to racism and violence. Institutions such as the media, police, schools, work, etc. all contribute to our positive and negative explicit and implicit (unconscious) biases.  
  
The media broadcasts stories and images of urban violence, racial discord, and police violence, giving us unconscious associations between blackness and poverty + neighborhood disinvestment. The media also promotes solutions such as "War on Crime," which in turn contribute to more systemic racism and help push laws and policies that limit our freedoms.  
  
The media significantly informs social implicit biases. While some police are explicitly racist, everyone, including the police, teachers, doctors, etc. have implicit (unconscious) biases that affect their understandings and decisions. Explicit and implicit social biases lead to more people calling the police on Black Americans, the police targeting Black Americans for routine traffic stops, more police using disproportionate amount of force (much of which is deadly), and more.  
  
The media then publicizes these events, further reinforcing our assumptions. While those who do harm to others and corrupt police officers must be held accountable (we see the police force as a tool of the state and the Capitalist class and therefore believe it should be dismantled so that we can have [community control/policing](https://komun-academy.com/2018/08/08/hpc-the-future-of-community-justice-peace-and-security/)), we also need to recognize that structural racism exists as a function of Capitalism.
