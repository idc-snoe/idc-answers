By fearing (and thereby shunning) members of a minority group and discriminating against them in your day-to-day interactions, you help contribute to those very "statistics" that you loosely reference, which exist not because of some genetic predisposition to crime, but because certain groups face heavy, systemic discrimination.  
  
The "statistics" only paint the picture you currently see when removed from the context in which they came into being, and if you were to actually examine the reasons for why those statistics are now skewed the way that they are, you would find that the only actual, reasonable solution here is to help end discrimination (the system of [white supremacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy)) and as a result change those statistics for the better.
