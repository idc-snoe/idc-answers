Not all Black Americans are on welfare, so let's try not to generalize here.  
  
[In fact, the greatest number of welfare recipients (by race) are white.](https://www.thoughtco.com/who-really-receives-welfare-4126592)  
  
Let's address this issue in relation to poor and working class Black Americans who are on welfare, though.  
  
[Giving financial support to the poor allows them to spend more of their income on the things they need. This is true even when cash is given with no strings attached, and no, poor folks do **not** spend whatever money is given to them on more drugs or alcohol, and studies indicate that if anything, financial support leads to less spending on drugs or alchohol.](https://qz.com/853651/definitive-data-on-what-poor-people-buy-when-theyre-just-given-cash/)  
  
What's really hurting Black people in America today is racism and our inherently exploitative economic system (Capitalism).  
  
Lee Atwater – a political strategist popular for working under Nixon – summed it up best in 1981: [this interview exposes the racist beginnings of the drug war and the article exposes the sentiments that pushed anti-Black white southerners to the Republican Party](https://www.thenation.com/article/exclusive-lee-atwaters-infamous-1981-interview-southern-strategy/).  
  
It's white supremacy and Capitalism that's hurting us. We're obviously hurt more as Black Americans under our current system, and this is no secret, but this is because of the hand we've been dealt by this country since our ancestors were brought here on slave ships centuries ago.  
  
PS: Just 10% of the federal budget goes toward welfare programs.
