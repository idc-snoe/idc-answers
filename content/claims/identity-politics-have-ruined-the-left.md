What do you mean when you say "identity politics" exactly?  
  
Are you referring to race reductionism (people who reduce everything to race)?  
  
Are you referring to people with different backgrounds moving in self-determination?  
  
We think it's important that we differentiate between Liberal identity politics, and Leftist identity politics. The former is a tool used by (Neo)Liberals to keep poor and working-class people divided, while the latter is about ensuring less-represented voices and concerns get heard in an international movement to dismantle Capitalism.  
  
If anything, class reductionism has "ruined" the (actual) Left while Liberals (not Leftists) with no conception of an anti-racist and anti-capitalist future have co-opted inherently anticapitalist concepts rooted in identity.
