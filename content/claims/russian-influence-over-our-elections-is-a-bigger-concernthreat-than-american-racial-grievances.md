What a, dare we say... privileged position to take.  
  
This stance completely overlooks the reality of voter suppression that Black Americans and other ethnic minorities have had to deal with.  
  
Gerrymandering, social media manipulation, ex-offenders being indefinitely stripped of voting rights, and all forms of voter suppression are a far bigger threat to our semi-democratic institutions (what many call "democracy," although we understand that Liberal representative "democracy" isn't democracy at all) than Russian influence over our elections.  
  
Not to mention that the U.S. capitalist class (and state) regularly fixes democratic elections in other countries for their interests and even helped Putin rise to power in Russia!  
  
If anything, U.S. Liberals reaped what they sowed in 2016.
