Many of our white comrades would say that our struggles do affect them, and that even if they didn't, they would still care because they have a base level of care for other human beings.  
  
Other people matter.  
  
But let's go one step further and say that it doesn't affect you and other people don't matter. It may very well affect you in the future, may it not? Why let it get to that point? Cut it out at the roots.  
  
That's the point.  
  
If you don't care when it doesn't affect you, by the time that it does affect you, it will be too late. And the people that will be able to do something about it because it doesn't affect them, won't, just as you didn't.
