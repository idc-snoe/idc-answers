The national anthem literally has [racist lyrics](https://amhistory.si.edu/starspangledbanner/the-lyrics.aspx).  
  
[The troops (of all types of ethnicities) fight imperialist wars for oligarchs that don't care about them](https://ratical.org/ratville/CAH/warisaracket.pdf).  
  
The U.S. government has lied to its citizens to start the last six major wars on false pretenses.  
  
The U.S. flag is not a symbol of hope, but of hate, to much of the world.  
  
If this statement is really about folks like Colin Kaepernick...  
  
Kaepernick originally sat during the national anthem but started kneeling out of respect to the troops after reaching out to veterans. The controversy surrounding this method of protest has clouded the message of the protest against police brutality.  
  
Kaepernick cannot stand for a country in which young Black boys can be shot by police for existing without consequence.
