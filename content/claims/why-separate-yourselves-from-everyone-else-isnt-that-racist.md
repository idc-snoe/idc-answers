We can not just advocate for ending Capitalist oppression, but we can also put specific ways in which the Black community is oppressed in the spotlight, while advocating for equality.  
  
Not having that additional input from a marginalized community might end up perpetuating oppression from society, even if the socialist revolution succeeds.  
  
This might be independent from actual policy. Maybe a Socialist leader is not antisemitic or racist, but without educating the people, any socialist policy's effect will be dampened.  
  
BSA is not opposed or in contrast to white Socialists any more than it would be antithetical to a Black Socialists of Belgium, if such a group were to exist. The fact that "Black" in the title of our organization brings about discomfort, tension, and/or suspicion is why it is so important for this organization to exist, as it represents a community under an oppressive system of white supremacy, which is disproportionately impacted by Capitalism.  
  
As such, we oppose Capitalism and white supremacy (not white people), while representing the socioeconomic interests of many Black American Leftists as a critical agent and voice in a cross-racial and multiethnic socialist movement.
