**That's good to hear. Now let's talk about the institutions that oppress Black people and other people of color**.  
  
**Structural racism** is pervasive in U.S. policies, organizations, and across institutional domains, producing and sustaining racial inequality.  
  
In the educational system, for example, minority students are graded differently and are disproportionately disciplined, and this causes many Black students to get left behind in said system, while their white counterparts move ahead.  
  
Access to housing and credit, as well as the terms and location options associated with this access, also remain impacted by race.  
  
Black and/or "foreign"-sounding names are less likely to get call-backs for housing, medical, and/or other essential services, and are less likely to be admitted to quality educational institutions, receive call-backs for jobs, and more.  
  
Whites benefit directly and indirectly from all of this, and often contribute to the maintenance of this system, without even knowing it.  
  
Most of the capitalist class in America is also made up of white Americans. This means they have control of most of our major industries and institutions (this includes the government and greater state apparatus as well), and so the mechanisms that maintain and push white supremacy (control) throughout our greater society are extremely pervasive all throughout the country.
