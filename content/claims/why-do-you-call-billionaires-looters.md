*Definition of **loot** \ ˈlüt  1: goods usually of considerable value taken in war*

For decades working class people have been forced to watch their [communities give massive tax breaks to monopolies](https://www.salon.com/2019/06/20/walmart-got-a-2-2-billion-tax-cut-now-its-laying-off-workers/) while allowing those same monopolies to [weaken working conditions and labour standards](https://www.newsweek.com/amazon-drivers-warehouse-conditions-workers-complains-jeff-bezos-bernie-1118849) as [wealth inequality unsurprising grows](https://www.forbes.com/sites/pedrodacosta/2019/05/29/americas-humungous-wealth-gap-is-widening-further/#2f1f632b42ee). To become a billion dollar institution, a company must make use of the schools to employ a workforce, of the roads and utilities to create and distribute product, and of a healthy and able consumer to purchase their product. Yet the [biggest companies do not pay their fair share in taxes](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/16/these-91-fortune-500-companies-didnt-pay-federal-taxes-in-2018.html) and effectively become a parasite on the broader community which now relies on workers and small businesses to pay more and more in a tightening ecosystem. This viscious cycle has been exascerbated by the COVID-19 crises.

In America alone, a handful of billionaires have [increased their wealth by $434 billion dollars](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/21/american-billionaires-got-434-billion-richer-during-the-pandemic.html) through a few months of a pandemic that has claimed the lives of thousands of essential workers, with most outside of the medical field struggling to earn a living wage.

As Warren Gunnels tweeted, "Looting is 25 billionaires increasing their wealth by $255 billion in 2 months while up to 580 million people throughout the world are pushed into poverty during this horrific pandemic. That's looting."

The number's don't lie, [we're in the middle of a class war](https://www.epi.org/blog/yes-david-brooks-there-really-is-a-class-war/) and $40 shoes aren't the goods of considerable value being stolen from communities - it's the bailouts and corporate rebates paid to energy companies and billionaires from your taxes.
