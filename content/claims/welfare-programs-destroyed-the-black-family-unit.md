That's like saying Neosporin and bandages applied to a gigantic arm gash in need of stitches were actually what caused the gash.  
  
Welfare programs are a response to a problem, and our problem runs much deeper than what welfare programs alone can address.  
  
We would argue that the reasons and circumstances that lead families to needing "welfare assistance" to begin with are the core problem (white supremacy and Capitalism are the two major "reasons").
