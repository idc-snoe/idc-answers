"All lives matter" is a clever trick.  
  
Imagine getting shot in the leg and saying that you don't want to lose your leg, and someone who is not wounded walking up and saying, "No one wants to lose their arm either."  
  
"No one wants to lose their arm" is a pretty reasonable position if you don't consider anything else.  
  
But if you consider the circumstances and the context, it is actually a nonsense thing to state.  
  
If someone walked into a seminar being held by breast cancer researchers and started yelling that "all cancer matters," and that "breast cancer researchers should be studying colon cancer instead," they'd be laughed out of the room because 1) of course all cancer matters, but 2) the only reason other kinds of cancer would be played off each other like that is to derail the conversation.  
  
If your house was burning down and you asked someone to call the fire department, imagine if they told you that "all houses matter."  
  
Should they tell the fire department to attend to every house (even the ones not currently on fire)?  
  
This is "all lives matter" in a nutshell.  
  
It makes the preposterous claim that everyone has started out equally and thus everyone should be attended to equally, when that is demonstrably false.  
  
Furthermore, it feigns the victimhood of white people by implying that white lives are being ignored (poor and working-class white Americans have, up until now, collectively chosen to take the psychological wage that comes under white supremacy and Capitalism instead of working with poor and working-class Black Americans to dismantle these systems and build a better world).  
  
The Black Lives Matter movement, even with all of its flaws, has not argued that Black lives matter more, but rather that Black lives matter **JUST AS MUCH**; there is an implicit "too" that goes along with "Black Lives Matter" (Black Lives Matter **Too**).
