Did systemic racism as we understand it today exist prior to Capitalism (mercantile or otherwise)?  
  
Racial categories were originally created to define an economic class: slaves.  
  
In addition, they served as an ideological tool to prevent poor whites from allying with Black people who actually share their class interests.  
  
Gender has also been used in order to regulate social roles.  
  
These aren't separate systems of oppression that "occasionally" intersect; they are fundamentally interconnected.  
  
The source of these is the ways we, as a society, regulate the production, distribution, and exchange of the means of our survival.  
  
Bigotry doesn't come out of some abstract hate; it emerges to fulfill a societal need to justify the conditions of our society.  
  
The only way we can even begin to seriously solve our problems is by changing our society at the most fundamental level: the economic level.  
  
This is not to suggest class is "more important" than race or gender, but that we should dispense with this kind of false dichotomy.  
  
Secondly, Socialists have been at the forefront of women's liberation and the liberation of people of color. Whether it was W.E.B. DuBois, A. Philip Randolph, Ella Baker, Fannie Lou Hamer, Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Huey P. Newton, Fred Hampton, etc. (we could keep going, and for a very long time).  
  
Try telling them (or us) that attacking the issue of class will make people "ignore" race and gender (and more broadly, identity).
