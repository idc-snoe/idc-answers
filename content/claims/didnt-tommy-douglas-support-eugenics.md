While he wrote a paper supporting eugenics in his school years, he quickliy renounced the idea after seeing it implemented in Germany.

Once premier, he rejected pressure to implement an eugenics program despite other provinces doing so and instead created programs to help those he once called subnormal.

Today we read his thesis through the lens of history, after the Nazi’s genocidal policies forever warped eugenics into a grotesque social experiment. Douglas himself recognized this change long before most others did. When he visited Germany in 1936 as an ambassador for the World Youth Congress, he attended one of Adolf Hitler’s rallies. There he experienced a “frightful” epiphany that led him to reject his earlier beliefs.

When he took public office as the premier of Saskatchewan in 1944, he resisted pressures to implement a eugenics program. While the premiers in B.C. and Alberta and the governors of 24 U.S. states passed laws mandating sterilization, Douglas brought in programs to provide therapies and vocational training for the people he once labelled “subnormal.”
