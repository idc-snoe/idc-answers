Eugene Debs wasn't right about everything, but he was certainly right about a lot.  
  
We'll leave you with this quote from him that is a core part of our philosophy:  
  
"While there is a lower class, I am in it.  
While there is a criminal element, I am of it.  
And while there is a soul in prison, I am not free."
