In an ideal, post-racial world, yes.  
  
But we do not live in this ideal, post-racial world.  
  
We must address the very real, systemic racism together in order to work through the divisions and bring everyone onto the same page of action.  
  
Furthermore, it is worth keeping in mind that Black Americans are not responsible for "race." It is "white" people (Europeans) who created and developed "race" as a social construct.
