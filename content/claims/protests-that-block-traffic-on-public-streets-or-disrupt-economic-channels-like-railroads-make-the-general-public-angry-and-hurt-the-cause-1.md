**TL;DR**

While there can be value in non-disruptive protests, many successful, historic protest actions we now recognize as incredibly effective purposefully created disruption. This was a deliberate tactic which forced the public and, by extension, the people in power to address the concerns of those protesting, even though [public opinion at the time opposed the protests](https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/going-too-far-american-publics-attitudes-toward-protest-movements).

![why can't you protest peacefully, not not like that meme image](/images/uploads/why-can-t-you-protest-peacefully-meme.jpg)

Two assumptions underlie the claim:

1. **There are right and wrong ways to protest. The forms of protest that don’t anger the general public are the right ways to protest.**

There are many methods of direct action and protest (take, for example, [this list of 198 methods of non-violent action](https://www.brandeis.edu/peace-conflict/pdfs/198-methods-non-violent-action.pdf)). No one method is strictly better or more right than another. Each has its own strategic application depending on the stage of the movement and the scale of the issue.

Some methods are certainly more "disruptive" to the public than others: petitioning, email and phone campaigns, or attending public forums, for example, are less disruptive than blocking traffic on a public street or boycotting a business. While these less disruptive methods can have some success with more uncontroversial issues (like banning plastic bags and straws), [they're easily ignored by people in power over greater systemic ones](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/why-petitions-are-almost-always-a-staggering-waste-of-time) (like police brutality, land disputes, etc.). Because the issue being advocated for doesn’t affect those in power, inaction at this stage costs them nothing, no matter how many pointed phone calls they get.

When activists resort to disruptive tactics of direct action, it’s because the less disruptive tactics have failed. They produced no results, and further inaction on their part costs further lives and livelihoods of those suffering under the injustices of the issue being fought for. Thus, they must resort to more disobedient, disruptive methods.

Making the general public angry, while it might seem bad optics, generates awareness not just for the protest but the movement as a whole. While the public directs their irritation towards the protestors, this actually puts pressure on their political representatives to take care of them. Martin Luther King Jr. explored this idea in his famous ["Letter from Birmingham Jail"](https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html) which he wrote after being arrested for participating in such a demonstration:

> "You may well ask: 'Why direct action? Why sit ins, marches and so forth? Isn't negotiation a better path?" You are quite right in calling for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored ... The purpose of our direct action program is to create a situation so crisis packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation. I therefore concur with you in your call for negotiation. Too long has our beloved Southland been bogged down in a tragic effort to live in monologue rather than dialogue ... We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed."

We can see King's words reflected even in today's movements. For example, [despite much of the negative press and public opinion surrounding the Wet'suwet'en land defence and solidarity demonstrations of early 2020](https://www.macleans.ca/opinion/the-wetsuweten-are-more-united-than-pipeline-backers-want-you-to-think/), the issue became a centrepiece in government discussions for weeks which eventually opened the door to [much-needed negotiations with the Wet'suwet'en traditional governance](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/wetsuweten-memorandum-agreement-rights-title-1.5551616). Far from hurting the cause, the more disruptive methods of protest are directly responsible for furthering it.

With consistent direct action like this over time, solving the root cause of the protests becomes easier than continuing to deal with the protests themselves.

Now, the second assumption:

2. **Protests should strive to gain people’s support, not their frustration, otherwise they only hurt the cause.**

[Protest movements always look better in hindsight](https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/going-too-far-american-publics-attitudes-toward-protest-movements). Many historic protests and demonstrations which achieved success had little public support, despite us looking back to them now as being on the “right side of history."

For example, polls taken around the time of the 1963 civil rights march where Martin Luther King Jr. gave his famous “I Have A Dream” speech showed that four in ten Americans had an [unfavourable opinion of the planned protest](https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/going-too-far-american-publics-attitudes-toward-protest-movements). Three years later, a 1966 poll found 50% of white Americans believed King was hurting the “Negro cause of civil rights."

Many of the tactics used by King and his fellow demonstrators included [blocking streets in marches, disrupting local economies through boycotts and sit-ins, and other effective methods of civil disobedience](https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2012/0115/Martin-Luther-King-Jr.-8-peaceful-protests-that-bolstered-civil-rights/Montgomery-bus-boycott-1955-56) which, at the time, aggravated the general public. But in hindsight, the public's frustration seems irrelevant since we remember the movement by its successes, not its detractors. It would be an awkward, ahistorical take to look back on King and the civil rights movement, acknowledge its importance and success, yet still argue that they "shouldn’t have blocked the streets and disrupted the general public.” It ignores how it was those direct actions taken by King and his contemporaries that led to the movement’s successes. 

Of course public support is important. But even if 90% of people think an existing law is unjust or that part of a system needs fixing, that alone does not work to change it. Unless we speak up and hold our political leaders accountable, they have little to no reason to change anything.

Support alone doesn’t make change. Martin Luther King Jr. for one believed that the greater obstacle to black equality was not direct opposition from white supremacists (like the KKK) but the supportive yet cautious “white moderate,” who agreed with the cause but not the “non-violent direct action":

> "I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to 'order' than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: 'I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action'; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a 'more convenient season.' Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection."

"White moderates,” like our cautious centrists of today, don’t bring about meaningful social change by waiting for the right moment, whether for everyone's public support, for the next election, or for the slow, resource-exhausting legal system to pop out a verdict. Almost every movement in history leading up to now that we take for granted—40-hour work weeks and weekends, women’s suffrage, racial justice, LGBTQ+ rights, and so on—was caused by radicals taking direct, political action.
