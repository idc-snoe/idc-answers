You'd be had pressed to find someone who cared more about strangers than they cared about themselves and their immediate relatives and friends. Socialism can however be promoted based on purely selfish reasons if you so choose. If your friends or your family get sick or lose their jobs, do you want to be the one who has to take care of them and bear that financial burden? Probably not - so why not support a free and universal healthcare system, or a better unemployment system. Socialism helps take the burden off of your back, and allows you to live more securly, free of having to be concerned financially for those you love. 

During the victorian era, a bill was raised in the british parliament that would have mandated that all new houses must be built with bathtubs. A Tory MP argued against this saying that the poor were so stupid and ignorant that they would just use the bathtubs as storage, so why give them one. In reply, the member who had tabled the bill said "Sir, I don't want them to have a bath for their sake, I want them to have a bath for my sake." 

Do you like having the garage collected, and parks looked after, and not having sick and homeless people dying in the streets? These are all addressed best by government programs, and social programs that assist people, this is socialism. If you don't want to be a socialist for empathetic reasons, be a socialist for selfish reasons.
