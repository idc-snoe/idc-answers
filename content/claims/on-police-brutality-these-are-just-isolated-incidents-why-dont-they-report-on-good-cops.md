Cops already have overwhelmingly positive media coverage.  
  
For example, news outlets typically says things like "suspect was killed in a police-involved shooting" rather than "police shot an unarmed and compliant civilian."  
  
It's actually a vanishingly rare circumstance where the news gives police brutality fair coverage; the reason it stands out in your mind is because it's such an unusual happening.  
  
If the news reported on police brutality (and the corruption that follows in allowing such officers to go free without meaningful consequence) in an unbiased manner, it would take wall-to-wall coverage every day of the year to address the scope of this problem.  
  
Furthermore, policing as an institution in America is founded on white supremacy. Policing as an institution in America was [started to catch runaway slaves](https://plsonline.eku.edu/insidelook/brief-history-slavery-and-origins-american-policing), and to this day the racist trend continues ([neo-Nazis have been infiltrating police ranks for decades now](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/fbi-white-supremacists-in-law-enforcement)). All police are serving an institution that is predicated on economic and racial injustice since the laws of the land themselves do so.  
  
[A Nixon official was quoted as saying the reason Nixon stated the war on drugs was to target hippies and Blacks, and that's but one example](https://www.cnn.com/2016/03/23/politics/john-ehrlichman-richard-nixon-drug-war-blacks-hippie/index.html).
