The "establishment" is unabashedly guilty and even hypocritical, so why would we trust it on anything, let alone "self-regulation"? Most poor and working-class folks don't like this setup (Capitalism); we're just the ones explaining why this is, and how we can actually dismantle the setup (Capitalism) entirely.
