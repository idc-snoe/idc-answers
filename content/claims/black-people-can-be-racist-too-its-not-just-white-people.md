This all depends on what you mean when you say "racist." Usually when someone says this, what they're really trying to do is equate prejudices expressed or acted upon by Black Americans with the racism and prejudice of "white" Americans. This leaves out centuries of historical context, as well as the context of our present circumstances. Black Americans only make up 12.6% of the U.S. population and "white" Americans hold most of the institutional power, so it's worth thinking about the big picture here.
