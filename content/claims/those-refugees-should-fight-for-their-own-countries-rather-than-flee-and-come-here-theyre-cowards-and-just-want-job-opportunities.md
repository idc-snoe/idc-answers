Most of the refugees you're referencing are probably refugees because of American foreign policy.  
  
Telling people displaced and suffering because of policies put in place by your government to "stay and fight" is not only deeply inhumane, but nonsensical.  
  
Also, who are these refugees supposed to fight for?  
  
In a civil war, there are no obvious invading and defending forces.
