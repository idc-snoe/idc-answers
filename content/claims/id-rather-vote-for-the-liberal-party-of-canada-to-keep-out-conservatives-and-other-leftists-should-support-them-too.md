Canadian Liberals are centre-right at best.

Agitation with Justin Trudeau and the Liberal party only gets more concentrated as leftists attempt to reconcile how damaging the Liberal party is to leftist organizing when compared to a conservative government. There are several reasons for this discomfort:

1. He is far worse at actually governing. Other than [freedom of information](https://www.canadalandshow.com/liberal-freedom-of-information-bill-garbage/), [press freedom](https://www.lawnow.org/in-canada-and-elsewhere-freedom-of-speech-is-on-the-endangered-list/), and [foreign aid declining under Trudeau](https://www.cips-cepi.ca/2017/04/02/harper-lite-the-trudeau-government-on-foreign-aid/), organizations like refugee support at least got paid on time. Many services which Harper lambasted, but continued to fund, actually [had to be cut under Trudeau because orgs (nevermind federal employees) weren't getting paid when promised](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/11/21/feds-struggling-to-track-impact-of-its-effort-to-resettle-syrian-refugees-auditor-general-says.html) and like the auditor general confirmed, are suffering under questionable leadership across government. The long form census Trudeau reinstated? [The head of StatsCan resigned because their data was compromised and Trudeau didn't care about implementation, just the look of reinstatement](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/statscan-wayne-smith-resigns-1.3765765).
2. His lies appease the agitation needed for real change. [Electoral reform](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/02/13/canadians-wanted-their-government-to-reflect-the-national-vote-but-these-reforms-arent-happening/), [ending fossil fuel subsidies](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/02/14/news/its-pulling-teeth-catherine-mckenna-accused-stalling-fossil-fuel-subsidies), and [a public infrastructure investment bank](https://pressprogress.ca/why-the-liberal-governments-infrastructure-bank-is-helping-big-banks-and-dumping-user-fees-on-citizens/) were all lies that the avg. Canadian forgets about. Climate change? [He stole Harper's ideas and targets](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/liberals-back-away-from-setting-tougher-carbon-targets-1.3075857). Too many think he's progressive because the Cons hate him and are satisfied they're fulfilling a progressive agenda simply by voting for him. This makes it harder for true progressives to affect change. [At least the lobbyists love him.](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-number-of-lobbyist-meetings-continues-to-climb-under-trudeau/). That should tell you something.
3. Long term, he's doing more harm to progressives than the Cons. The cons get to paint carbon tax as extreme and eradicate it - [despite it being lower than what Harper had been planning](https://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/stephen-harpers-tax-on-everything/), because the Liberals didn't introduce a truly left plan with additional measures. The Conservatives get to paint refugees in a negative light because the Liberals didn't introduce a truly progressive immigration plan, and like the auditor general warned in 2017, [didn't measure successes of the program so we have no proof to fight alt-right smears](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/11/21/feds-struggling-to-track-impact-of-its-effort-to-resettle-syrian-refugees-auditor-general-says.html). The conservatives get to fight unions because Trudeau set the "left" standard at[ legislating an end to strike instead of creating worker protections](https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/trudeau-government-introduces-back-to-work-legislation-to-end-canada-post-strike-1.4187960) all while his incompetence drives Canadians to [distrust public institutions and political efforts](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-february-16-2017-1.3984460/majority-of-canadians-distrust-government-poll-suggests-1.3984577). If a Conservative was in power, at least the left could capture that outrage for positive ends, but most Canadians don't bat an eye because Trudeau's most powerful lie is painting his actions as left and dragging the overton window right.
