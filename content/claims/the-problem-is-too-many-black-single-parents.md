Although the prevalence of single parenthood is definitely an issue, it is not **thee** problem.  
  
**Thee** problem is and always has been colonialism, capitalism, imperialism, and white supremacy (amongst many other things).  
  
We have to ask ourselves why this particular issue that is mentioned is indeed so common, and analyze the issue through a more structuralist framework.  
  
Black Americans are more negatively impacted by our racist criminal justice system and are therefore more likely to go to jail than if they were white. What could this mean for Black fathers? See [here](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/research-publications/2017/20171114_Demographics.pdf) if you want a closer look (if you want one specific example, [feel free to look at the shenanigans surrounding marijuana possession](https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/aclu-thewaronmarijuana-rel2.pdf)).  
  
Also, let's just say we're going to look at Black fathers leaving by choice; here, the problem isn't "race" (some sort of genetic predisposition, as some seem to imply), but rather **poverty**.  
  
If you found yourself with someone who is pregnant, but you barely had enough to make ends meet just taking care of yourself (add this to the issue of [job discrimination](https://hbr.org/2017/10/hiring-discrimination-against-black-americans-hasnt-declined-in-25-years)), then you would probably leave (most would); if we solved the problems of poverty and the other systemically racist mechanisms plaguing predominantly Black and brown communities, then the single parenthood rate would most definitely go down in these areas.
