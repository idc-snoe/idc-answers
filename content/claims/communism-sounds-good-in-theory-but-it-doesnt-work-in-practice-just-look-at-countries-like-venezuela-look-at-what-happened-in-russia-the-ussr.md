It is important to differentiate between a socialist/communist society, and a "socialist/communist" state (the latter does not exist beyond a mere label, which doesn't mean much).  
  
Venezuela is not a socialist country. It has State Capitalism and used oil money to fund welfare programs when oil production was high and prices were solid.  
  
It's also heavily sanctioned by foreign nations such as the United States.  
  
The USSR also represented State Capitalism and faced several challenges, including a massive drought, and was actively worked against by foreign nations such as the United States.  
  
Additionally, market planning in a "socialist" state requires massive amounts of computing power, and technology at the outset of most 19th and 20th century socialist/communist movements were not powerful enough to facilitate the market planning that was required. Many of the issues these movements faced then, we would not face today.
