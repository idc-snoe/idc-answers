Telling someone to be grateful for their own abduction is absurd, especially when there are so many obvious problems now ([colonialism's effects in modern day Africa would still affect Blacks if they were "left"](https://www.pambazuka.org/global-south/effects-colonialism-africas-past-and-present)).
