If you don't see color, then you don't see the everyday struggles people go through because of color.  
  
Color-blind ideology is a post Civil Rights, socially-sanctioned form of racism. It advocates that since the Civil Rights Movement, structural inequalities are insignificant and suggests that the best way to end the remnants of discrimination that still exist is by asserting that race does not matter.  
  
Color-blindness accepts that racism is personal rather than societal and institutional. In not recognizing race, color-blindness not only denies stark differences in others in terms of income, wealth, poverty, and education, but also the salience of race in their own lives. When they participate in multiculturalist activities such as "New Age Native American spirituality" or the "local hip-hop scene," they remove and dilute racial and ethnic meanings and replace them with color-blind ones.  
  
More starkly, racism is typically viewed as isolated acts by ignorant people and extremist hate groups. Even institutional acts, such as racial profiling by police or the disproportionate impact of mortgage lending to Blacks and Latinos, are in the least calls for punishment of "bad apples," and at the most temporary regional media scandals rather than the recognition of systemic racism rooted in our societal framework.  
  
In practice, white people who subscribe to color-blindness shamelessly obscure the institutional arrangements reproducing structural inequalities, while maintaining the racial status quo.
