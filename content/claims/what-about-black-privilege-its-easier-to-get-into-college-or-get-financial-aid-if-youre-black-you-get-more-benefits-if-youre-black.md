[Yet despite an increase in enrollment, Black Americans are still lagging behind in college population.](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/pdf/coe_cpb.pdf)  
  
[Many of the factors that contribute to one being able to attend college are inherited, meaning your family's economic status is a strong indicator of whether you can attend college or not](https://www.stlouisfed.org/household-financial-stability/the-demographics-of-wealth/the-financial-returns-from-college-across-generations).  
  
[The wealth gap is extremely wide between white and Black, taken as an average or a median. A median white family has 10x the wealth of a median Black family.](https://www.epi.org/blog/racial-gaps-in-wages-wealth-and-more-a-quick-recap/)  
  
This leads to the final point, as these differences exist even when controlling for other factors:  
  
Even if Black Americans make it to college, their wages are much lower than whites, and this has actually gotten worse since the 1970s.
