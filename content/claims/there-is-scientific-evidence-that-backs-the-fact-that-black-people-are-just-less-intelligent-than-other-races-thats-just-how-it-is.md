title: "There is scientific evidence that backs the fact that black people are just less intelligent than other races; that's just how it is."

[Black people (in the racial sense) aren't inherently less intelligent than other races, and to posit otherwise would be entirely unscientific, because there is no scientific basis for such a claim](https://www.cell.com/ajhg/pdf/S0002-9297(18)30363-X.pdf). Black people, just like all other people, are shaped largely by their environments.  
  
Now if you'd like to discuss the environments Black people have been shaped by, that's another (much longer) discussion.  
  
You could start with the fact that our ancestors came to the U.S. as enslaved Africans. And the fact that, even after chattel slavery was abolished ([we still have the 13th Amendment, so slavery in general was never technically abolished](https://www.history.com/news/13th-amendment-slavery-loophole-jim-crow-prisons)), [most black schools were underfunded, and their teachers had an 8th grade education](https://www.aft.org/periodical/american-educator/summer-2004/jim-crows-schools).  
  
We could keep going. Maybe start [here](https://www.racialequitytools.org/resourcefiles/race_power_policy_workbook.pdf) if you're interested.
