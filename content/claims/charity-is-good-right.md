Charities are vertical distributions of power, often carrying bloated operational costs, dictatorial boards, and suffering from a conflict of interest wherein success would result in mass job loss.  Mutual aid is horizontal, where the affected must be directly involved in engineering solutions to ensure elimination of obstacles is truly and fully prioritized.\

### **Other Differentiating Factors**

**Horizontalist and Participatory Characteristics of Mutual Aid Projects**

* “Members” = people making decisions
* De-professionalized survival work done by volunteers
* Beg, borrow, and steal supplies
* Use people power to resist any efforts by government to regulate or shut down activities
* Survival work rooted in deep and wide principles of anti-capitalism, anti-imperialism, racial justice, gender justice, disability justice
* Open meetings, as many people making decisions and doing the work as possible
* Efforts to support people facing the most dire conditions
* Give things away without expectations
* People participate voluntarily because of passion about injustice
* Efforts to flatten hierarchies—e.g. flat wage scales if anyone is paid, training so that new people can do work they weren’t professionally trained to do, rotating facilitation roles, language access
* Values self-determination for people impacted or targeted by harmful social conditions
* Consensus decision-making to maximize everyone’s participation, to make sure people impacted by decisions are the ones making them, to avoid under-represented groups getting outvoted, and to build the skill of caring about each other’s participation and concerns rather than caring about being right or winning
* Direct aid work is connected to other tactics, including disruptive tactics aimed at root causes of the distress the aid addresses
* Tendency to assess the work based on how the people facing the crisis the organization wants to stop regard the work
* Engaging with the organization builds broader political participation, solidarity, mobilization, radicalization

**Characteristics of Hierarchical, Charitable Non-Profits and Social Service Programs (or what tends to change about mutual aid projects as they move toward becoming charities or social service programs)**

* “Members” = donors
* Service work staffed by professionals
* Grant money for supplies/philanthropic control of program
* Follow government regulations about how the work needs to happen (usually requiring more money, causing reliance on grants, paid staff with professional degrees)
* Siloed single-issue work, serving a particular population or working on one area of policy reform, disconnected from other ‘issues’
* Closed board meetings, governance by professionals or people associated with big institutions or big donors, program operated by staff, volunteers limited to stuffing envelopes or other menial tasks occasionally, volunteers not part of high level decision making
* Imposing eligibility criteria for services that divide people into “deserving” and “undeserving”
* Conditions for getting help or participating in something—you have to be sober, have a certain family status, have a certain immigration status, not have outstanding warrants, not have certain convictions, etc.
* People come looking for a job, wanting to climb a hierarchy or become “important”
* Establishing and maintaining hierarchies of pay, status, decision-making power, influence
* Offers “help” to “underprivileged” absent of a context of injustice or strategy for transforming the conditions; paternalistic; rescue fantasies and saviorism
* Person on top (often Executive Director) decides things or, in some instances, a board votes and majority wins
* Direct aid work disconnected from other tactics, depoliticized, and organization distances itself from disruptive or root causes-oriented tactics in order to retain legitimacy with government or funders
* Tendency to assess the work based on opinions of elites: political officials, bureaucrats, funders, elite media
* Engaging with the organization not aimed at growing participants’ engagement with other “issues,” organizations, or struggles for justice
