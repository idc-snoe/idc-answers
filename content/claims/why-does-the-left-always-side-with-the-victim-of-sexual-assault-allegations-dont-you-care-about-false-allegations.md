Yes, false accusation is a big deal, and yes, something should be done about it, but right now the best studies say [false allegations account for only 2-6% of allegations](https://www.vox.com/2015/6/1/8687479/lie-rape-statistics). A minuscule number when compared to [estimates that only 5% of Canadian sexual assaults are actually reported and only 37% of those charged are found guilty.](http://globalnews.ca/news/1845136/why-dont-women-report-rape-because-most-get-no-justice-when-they-do/)

So the question becomes where can we do the most good. If we can trust the above numbers, and use the high estimate of 6% of allegations are false:

**1,260 false accusations were made in 2009** (we don't know how many of those charges were dropped)

**451,000 sexual assault cases went unreported in 2009**

The staggering number of non-reporting victims (and the corresponding number of active rapists) is why most prioritize improving the rate of reporting vs imposing false accusation legislation.

We understand frustration over this issue - and share it. We wish there was evidence based legislation we could support on the topic, but [current false accusation policies aren't just wrong - they even make things worse for those falsely accused](https://qz.com/980766/the-truth-about-false-rape-accusations/).

> Critics argue that reports of rape should be treated with more caution, since men’s lives are so often ruined by women’s malicious lies.
>
> my research—including academic studies, journalistic accounts, and cases recorded in the US National Registry of Exoneration—suggests that every part of this narrative is wrong. What’s more, **it’s wrong in ways that help real rapists escape justice, while perversely making it more likely that we will miss the signs of false reports.**

Yes, the wrongfully accused absolutely deserve our support, but we need fact based options so we do not increase victims on both side of the equation.

Increasing the number of sexual assault's silent victims will only empower rapists further and make our country more dangerous for our children - [the primary victims of sexual assault in Canada](http://www.sexassault.ca/statistics.htm).
