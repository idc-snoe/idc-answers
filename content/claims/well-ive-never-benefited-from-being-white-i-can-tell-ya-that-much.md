This is a good opportunity to talk about the way that your position in life shapes the way you see things.  
  
You don't notice the ways that you benefit from being white because society has been (by and large) designed by people like you with you in mind. Bad things are less likely to happen to you because you are white â€“ that isn't to say that bad things couldn't happen to you in spite of you being white, of course.  
  
That's the difference between the experience of an ethnic minority in this country, and the experience of a person who identifies with the majority "white" culture. But people from other backgrounds have bad things happen to them and notice that it is because of them not being white. And they notice that because these things happen to them in addition to all of the bad things that happen to them for the same reasons that bad things happen to white people.  
  
We see it, and we notice it, because it hits our bottom line.  
  
So the ways that you've benefited from being white, in a society dominated by whiteness, is that bad things haven't happened to you because of your race. In contrast, bad things happen to non-white people in this county because of their race.  
  
[One of the most stunning statistics we can mention here is the average net worth of whites vs. "Hispanics" and Black Americans](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/recent-trends-in-wealth-holding-by-race-and-ethnicity-evidence-from-the-survey-of-consumer-finances-20170927.htm").  
  
It is stark.  
  
In 2016, white families had the highest level of both median and mean family wealth: $171,000 and $933,700, respectively (figure 1). Black and Hispanic families have considerably less wealth than white families. Black families' median and mean net worth is less than 15 percent that of white families, at $17,600 and $138,200, respectively. Hispanic families' median and mean net worth was $20,700 and $191,200, respectively.  
  
You are reading this right.  
  
Median white family wealth is $171,000 vs. $17,600 for Blacks, and $20,700 for "Hispanics."  
  
Although most families do have some wealth, the number with zero or negative net worth (having debts that exceed assets) is nontrivial and varies by race/ethnicity. Nearly one in five black households has zero or negative net worth. The share of white households without any wealth is considerably smaller, at 9 percent. Hispanic and other households fall somewhere in between white and black families on this measure.  
  
For many families, the primary residence is an important component of the balance sheet. Well over half of white households are homeowners (73 percent), compared with just under half of black and Hispanic households (around 45 percent) and 54 percent of other households. Among homeowners, white households also hold considerably higher levels of equity in their homes. Mean net housing wealth (the value of the home, less any debts on the home) among homeowners is $215,800 among white families but only $94,400 among black families and $129,800 among Hispanic families. White homeowners hold more home equity, but housing accounts for only 32 percent of their total assets, compared with 37 to 39 percent for black and Hispanic homeowners.  
  
In addition to substantial heterogeneity within race/ethnicity groups by education, there are also large disparities across race/ethnicity groups for families with similar levels of education. Among households headed by someone with a college degree, net worth is substantially higher for white families than for the other three groups of families. The median net worth of college graduates in 2016 was $397,100 for white families, but well below $100,000 for black families and Hispanic families.  
  
This advantage is hard to see for most white people, and for various reasons (mostly because most white people spend most of their time around other white people of the same, or a similar, class, which isn't something unique).
