Who are you referring to specifically?  
  
Right-wing violence is caused by people (such as the president) actively encouraging right-wing citizens to commit violent acts.  
  
Right-wing violence is caused by racist dog whistles that drive xenophobic hatred.  
  
Right-wing violence is caused by the spreading of lies about ethnic minorities.  
  
Right-wing violence is caused by the presence of Donald Trump on Infowars.  
  
Right-wing violence is caused by having anti-Semitic "political commentators" on television spreading disinformation.  
  
Right-wing violence is caused by the mainstreaming of fascist ideas.  
  
Aggressive protesting is what led to Richard Spencer declaring that "Antifa is winning."  
  
All of this said, though we know how the cookie typically crumbles, real revolutionary change does not necessitate violence.  
  
While many revolutions have been violent in the face of oppressive regimes, there have also been plenty of non-violent revolutions in history (Armenia just went through one in 2018). And the relationship between violence and revolution has been exaggerated.  
  
In the past, the dominant narrative has linked violence with rebellion because of their own military response to those who oppose oppression. Further, shocked by the threat to the existing order, the violence associated with rebellion and revolution has been distorted and greatly exaggerated by the hostile establishment and chroniclers who were the main sources of historical documentation.  
  
Revolutions have also been historically romanticized as violent in art, literature, and film to symbolically represent revolutionaries as heroic leaders willing to take up arms and to give up their lives as a demonstration of their commitment to the cause. It is in the hands of the capitalist class not to treat revolutionaries as irrational and bloodthirsty mobs, but to listen to reason and recognize them as politically organized, ideologically consistent, socially sanctioned movements of unarmed resistance. The claim that unarmed resisters are causing violence is the dominant narrative attempting to constrain, maintain, and impose control over the voice of the anti-racist, anti-capitalist opposition.
