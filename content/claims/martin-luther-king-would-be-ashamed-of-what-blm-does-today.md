MLK would most likely be proud of BLM for spotlighting police brutality and putting discussions about systemic racism at the forefront of our national sociopolitical dialogue.  
  
He probably wouldn't be a fan of their [Liberal (or "moderate") co-optation](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/aug/16/black-lives-matter-cashes-100-million-liberal-foun/), or their glaring [lack of economic policy and labor organizing strategies](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/08/movement-black-lives-platform/494309/).  
  
[You just seem like the exact type of "white moderate" MLK was talking about, though](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiGmujcobTfAhVsneAKHQ98CfwQzPwBegQIARAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fnews%2Fretropolis%2Fwp%2F2018%2F01%2F15%2Fmartin-luther-king-jr-s-scathing-critique-of-white-moderates-from-the-birmingham-jail%2F&psig=AOvVaw3NGWbvvz3XAlwN1hrwqgW6&ust=1545596484816555).
