[This is not the flag of the Confederacy.  
  
](https://goo.gl/images/MdCn2E)[This](https://goo.gl/images/CV9y7Z) was the first national flag, followed by "[The Stainless Banner](https://goo.gl/images/61iQN9)" (also know as The White Man's Flag) and then finally "[."  
  
The flag people call the "Confederate flag" is actually the Battle Flag of the Army of Tennessee (a square version was used by General Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia). It was not popularized until it was flown in "historical films" such as _The Birth of a Nation_, which is what inspired the second Klu Klux Klan. It was also flown in _Gone with the Wind_, amongst other films, and then later associated with "Southern Pride" when Dixiecrats started using it to oppose the Civil Rights Movement during the 1960s. It was integrated into Georgia's state flag in 1956 as a reaction to _Brown v. Board of Education_ and was raised by University of Mississippi during protests against integrating schools (a way of saying you are legally allowed to attend, but you are not welcome).  
  
Southern heritage, pride, and race are interlinked, therefore the support for the Confederate flag is not just about racial attitudes or southern heritage alone and/or separately, but both.  
  
The flag has been used for discriminatory purposes. It represents more than the Civil War and its official endorsement of slavery. It also stands for a history of vocal resistance to racial and political equality for Blacks and other minorities.  
  
The intensity of the political fight over the Confederate flag has actually led some researchers to investigate the "heritage" versus "hate" debate.  
  
Researchers found that a widespread defense of the Confederate flag among whites has much more to do with racial concerns than with other aspects of southern heritage. (Reingold, Beth, and Richard S. Wike. "Confederate Symbols, Southern Identity, and Racial Attitudes: The Case of the Georgia State Flag." _Social Science Quarterly_, vol. 79, no. 3, 1998, pp. 568â€“580.).  
  
The Confederate flag has been used by the KKK and other white supremacists who oppose racial justice up until today. Even government official George Wallace's 1963 "Segregation Forever" campaign included raising the Confederate flag. The symbolism and function of the Confederate flag therefore is not merely a neutral cultural object, but a ritual object of power, dominance, and subordination (Shanafelt, R. (2008)). _The nature of flag power: How flags entail dominance, subordination, and social solidarity. Politics and the Life Sciences_, 27(2), 13-27.).](https://goo.gl/images/wcWbfe)
