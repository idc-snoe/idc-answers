"Morality" is perceived differently all over the world, and has changed throughout history. But not in any specific direction.  
  
"Morality" isn't easily quantifiable over time, as the moral axioms have changed. What is perceived by us as immoral today, was considered perfectly fine by people a century ago.  
  
The definition of "justice" keeps changing, and so the "moral arc" tends to bend to justify ruling class domination.
