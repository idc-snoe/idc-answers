"Ways to be offended" is a common phrase among Conservatives reacting to "Political Correctness." It is an example of how [mainstream media exploits public fear and hatred as a social control mechanism](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.458.4091&rep=rep1&type=pdf).  
  
There are various theories about the origins of the actual phrase, but until the 1980s in the United States, it was usually used ironically exclusively by the Left. It didn't surface in mainstream American culture until 1990 when Richard Bernstein used it in a New York Times article to describe "unofficial ideology of the university . . . a cluster of opinions on race, ecology, feminism, culture and foreign policy defines a kind of â€˜correct' attitude towards the problems of the world."  
  
According to Moira Weigel, the article "set off a chain reaction, as one mainstream publication after another rushed to denounce this new trend," and often [exaggerating or stripping the context](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/30/political-correctness-how-the-right-invented-phantom-enemy-donald-trump).  
  
Books and media (both pro and con) quickly popularized concepts of "PC culture," which incited and spread fear among Conservatives about "Liberal fascism." The phrase entered mainstream U.S. culture as a trigger phrase in dichotomous "Liberal versus Conservative" political debate.  
  
In short, "people are looking for ways to be offended," is a product of fear propaganda by the media used to turn a profit.
