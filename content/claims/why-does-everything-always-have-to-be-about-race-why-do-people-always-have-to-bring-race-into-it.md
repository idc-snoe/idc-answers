Because the color of your skin predicts many of the outcomes you will experience in your life.  
  
Where racists will point to these facts and, incorrectly, claim these are essential and immutable qualities of the races, Socialists understand that these material conditions are caused by institutions of power, both formal and informal, that exist to support some over others (principally, the ruling class over the working class).  
  
Because race can be used as a wedge to divide us, society is structured to benefit some people over others. That is, if the majority have some semblance of privelege over the minority, people will fight to retain that scrap of power. In many cases, the manifestations of these small powers go unnoticed by those that possess them. In fact, to be free to not experience race is one of these. Those under the heel of great power do not enjoy that luxury. As a fist would be stronger than the fingers alone, we are atomized and one turned against the other.  
  
Lies about the essential nature of the races, that this essential nature is actually the cause of unfairly unequal outcomes, proliferate like weeds on fertile ground, both to defend a system of oppression and exploitation, as well as to trick segments of the working class so that they cannot see the shared struggle that ought to unite them. These unfair, unequal, and exploitative outcomes are something we all face laboring for Capitalists who steal the surplus value of what we produce. But these negative outcomes are suffered disproportionately by people of color.  
  
As Socialists, we believe that all people should have the same opportunities to live with dignity and purpose, to enjoy the fruits of our society (the produce of our shared labor), and to be free. The systemic oppression of people of color must be ended to realize that dream. We recognize the simple truth that this is struggle shared by the whole of the working class, that an injury to one is an injury to all, and that white workers must join in solidarity with laborers of color if we are to end differential outcomes based on the circumstances of one's birth.  
  
We are all people.  
  
It is upon this foundation of our shared humanity that we call upon our more priveleged comrades to recognize the struggles of the less priveleged, to turn those priveleges into weapons against the class that wish them to divide us, and to reject the temptations of small power thereby affirming the common fraternity of all.  
  
We are one people and we are many.  
  
We do not seek to erase the differences that make us each ourselves. We seek a world in which those differences are celebrated, not used to divide one from their siblings.  
  
It's about race because race determines too much of what we experience in life. It ought not to. We must right that wrong together.
