It is worth noting that many of the arguments and sentiments addressed here are not exclusively expressed by white Americans or white people in general, although this is the racial group we most frequently hear them being espoused by.
It is also worth differentiating between race and ethnicity.
When we say "white people," we're really referring to people with white skin (white-passing), or European Americans and/or Europeans, of which there are many different ethnic subcategories.
Race is a social construct based upon extremely broad, crude differences in phenotypic variation. It has nothing to do with shared histories, cultures, or beliefs (though it does influence what we’d call “ethnicity”), and everything to do with outward appearances. It is something that is still used today by the capitalist class and white supremacists in order to maintain divisions and hierarchical structures of power.
We refer to “race” as a “social construct” because the tiny genetic differences between humans are really only shaped by historical differences in geographical location, diet, and overall lifestyle; from a scientific standpoint, there is only ONE “race,” and it is the HUMAN race.
Many of us do not identify as "African Americans," for there are actual first, second, or third generation Africans in America whose ethnic histories have virtually nothing to do with ours, but they're "black" (lowercase "b") in the context of “race” because we share similar physical features.
Ethnicity refers to shared histories, cultures, religions, and more, and is also a social construct, though in a different way. Ethnicity represents “imagined communities” because it can be altered/redefined. That said, genes impact perception of “ethnicity,” but are not commanded by it. The origin of any kind of genetic mutation is not necessarily where it can be commonly found today. This means that even assigning genetic combinations to specific geographical areas, let alone entire ethnic groups, is an issue. Ethnic groups move around frequently, and take their DNA with them when they do. One ethnic group may contribute DNA to other ethnic groups at different times. Therefore, ethnic groups can’t be defined by location alone.
This is uppercase "B" (ethnicity) vs. lowercase "b" (race).
Black American (one ethnicity) vs. "black" American (multiple ethnicities).
We identify as "Black Americans" because we are a part of the African diaspora that ended up in what we now call “ North America”; the languages, diets, family structures, and overall cultures of our ancestors were decimated when they were brought to this land centuries ago (“decimation” is not the same as “obliteration,” though decimation entails great destruction; our Africanness was and is embedded in American creolization, but the original subcultures of our ancestors were significantly stripped from us). Since that time, we have developed our own shared history, culture(s), and beliefs, and this is something that shapes every element of our being. This is our ethnic identity.
For now, we use the term “Black” in identifying ourselves because that is all we have been to the colonialists of the world; one day, we will emerge with a new name that is not defined by the labeling of our historical oppressors. Some of our folks already go by new names (example: “New Afrikan”), and this is something that we must honor and respect.
Our focus here is, more than "white people," the system of white supremacy and how it warps all of our perspectives (regardless of race or ethnicity), keeping in mind that the data shows (and always has shown) that Black Americans suffer disproportionately under this system of white supremacy.
This is not us calling ourselves victims.
This is us stating that we've been victimized and scapegoated nonstop since the inception of this country, and demanding that it ends for the future of not only the United States, but the entire human species (this includes "white" Americans, who instead of choosing to challenge the most powerful oppressing everyone, have chosen to scapegoat the most vulnerable in exchange for a psychological wage that places them higher up in the socially constructed hierarchy of race, and Capitalism).
