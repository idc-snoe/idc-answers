		claim: `They're trying to erase white history!`,
		keywords: [`erase`, `white`, `history`],
		response: `<p>Not only is there not any real unitary "white" history, but there is something to be said here about the utility of history (as a subject in schools, for example).
		<br /><br />There is a common assumption that only the history of one's own culture should be taught, perhaps with a little international "stuff" stacked on top that either does not take into account what can be learned from the history of other cultures, or simply assumes one's own culture is the most important.
		<br /><br />Furthermore, "white" history is and always has been erased by the white and powerful people for their (the white <strong>and</strong> powerful) own benefit (from the way we gloss over all of the atrocities of Columbus, to the way we glorify the old royalty).
		<br /><br />The only people who have erased white history are those who intend to control you.
		<br /><br />"White" history for long stretches of time was just about white-washing the accomplishments of people of color, or claiming that said people of color were "white" themselves (from the invention of the lens, to basic physics, etc.).
		<br /><br />You can see it in the common depictions of Jesus, the Egyptians, or the Greeks.
		<br /><br />"White" people have always tried to associate anything good produced in the world with "white" people and their "effort" in order to feed into the false racial concept of meritocracy.
		<br /><br />"White" (European) heritage is being erased by all of the people refusing to look at the mistakes Europeans have made, and erasing the lessons all can learn from them.
		<br /><br />If you want to talk about "white" history being erased, perhaps it would be worth saying something about how our educational institutions don't tell us exactly how many people were in favor of lynching during its peak in popularity within America, so that you have historical context.
		<br /><br />If you don't want "white" history erased, perhaps it would be worth fighting to ensure that Europeans aren't homogenized into crude categories like "white" by encouraging others to read about the racial hierarchies that existed in the Spanish colonies and how they inform the racism of today.
		<br /><br />One should use this knowledge to understand that someone in power will always come up with a reason for you to hate your neighbor so they can oppress you both. Racism at large is just divisive, and to let the racists purify your "white" history so people with white skin seem "superior" just makes us forget the errors that "white" people have been a part of and continue to perpetuate.</p>`

		claim: `The Nazis were Socialists.`,
		keywords: [`nazi`, `nazis`],
		response: `<p>Boy, are you gonna be disappointed when you realize that Dairy Queen isn't actually a literal queen, or that the Philadelphia Flyers can't actually fly.
		<br /><br />We've also got some news for you about buffalo wings...
		<br /><br />Oh, and if the Nazis were Socialist, then Antifa must be anti-fascist, and certainly you don't support fascism, do you? You must support them based on the name alone, no?
		<br /><br />Okay, so here's the serious response...
		<br /><br />It is important to understand what the political climate of Germany was like in the 1920s, and why Hitler might have thought it wise to use the term "Socialism" (it's actually a trick that the fascists use a lot throughout history).
		<br /><br />Socialism was very popular in Germany before Hitler's rise to power (the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartacist_uprising">Spartacist Uprising</a> shows this).
		<br /><br />Hitler was not a fool; he used Socialism to get people on board.
		<br /><br />When Hitler came into power, things were getting bad economically. Hitler used this period as an opportunity to spread his form of "populism" (the fascists love fake populism). He even spoke in the language of the Left sometimes. He called himself a "National Socialist." This alone is a red flag (and not the good kind).
		<br /><br /><strong>Socialism is international in nature.</strong>
		<br /><br />However, it's not hard to see that actual Socialists were adamantly against Hitler at the time. The international Left in general was. It is no surprise that Hitler targeted the Left <strong>first</strong> when he came into power (<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came_...">Martin Niemöller's First They Came</a> poem is a contemporary account of this fact). Hitler wanted nothing to do with Socialism.
		<br /><br />If this is not enough to convince you, there are various speeches and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ub.edu/graap/nazi.pdf">policy points you can look at that quite literally represent the antithesis of Socialism</a>.
		<br /><br />So who benefited from Hitler's rise to power? Was it the people? Or Capitalists who received billions of dollars to build a war machine?
		<br /><br />Hitler (who was Nazism personified for Nazis) was a fan of eugenics, social darwinism, and was hostile to both unionism and Communism. He went about privatizing as much as he could and gave Capitalism whatever it needed as long as it was serving the fascist state. <strong>That is not Socialism</strong>.
		<br /><br />
		<span style="font-style:italic">
			"First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—
	    <br />  Because I was not a Socialist.
			<br />Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—
	    <br />  Because I was not a trade unionist.
			<br />Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
	    <br />  Because I was not a Jew.
			<br />Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me."

		<br /><br />When Socialism comes, we can tell you who it will benefit:

		<br /><br /><strong>The people.</strong>

		keywords: [`racism`,`liberal`, `media`],
		response: `<p>You already know what we're gonna say about the racism thing (come on, we all have social media and smartphones, so if you want to see racism in action today, just head on over to YouTube or Twitter and do a simple search), but let's address the Liberal media thing, because we don't really like Liberal or Conservative media very much (and that's putting it lightly).
		<br /><br />The relationships between institutions such as the mainstream media and police must be understood in the larger context of Capitalism as a class-based economic system that benefits from and contributes to racism and violence. Institutions such as the media, police, schools, work, etc. all contribute to our positive and negative explicit and implicit (unconscious) biases.
		<br /><br />The media broadcasts stories and images of urban violence, racial discord, and police violence, giving us unconscious associations between blackness and poverty + neighborhood disinvestment. The media also promotes solutions such as "War on Crime," which in turn contribute to more systemic racism and help push laws and policies that limit our freedoms.
		<br /><br />The media significantly informs social implicit biases. While some police are explicitly racist, everyone, including the police, teachers, doctors, etc. have implicit (unconscious) biases that affect their understandings and decisions. Explicit and implicit social biases lead to more people calling the police on Black Americans, the police targeting Black Americans for routine traffic stops, more police using disproportionate amount of force (much of which is deadly), and more.
		<br /><br />The media then publicizes these events, further reinforcing our assumptions. While those who do harm to others and corrupt police officers must be held accountable (we see the police force as a tool of the state and the Capitalist class and therefore believe it should be dismantled so that we can have <a target="_blank" href="https://komun-academy.com/2018/08/08/hpc-the-future-of-community-justice-peace-and-security/">community control/policing</a>), we also need to recognize that structural racism exists as a function of Capitalism.</p>`

		keywords: [`racist`,`i'm not racist`,`personally`,`racist bone`],
		response: `<p><strong>That's good to hear. Now let's talk about the institutions that oppress Black people and other people of color</strong>.
		<br /><br /><strong>Structural racism</strong> is pervasive in U.S. policies, organizations, and across institutional domains, producing and sustaining racial inequality.
		<br /><br />In the educational system, for example, minority students are graded differently and are disproportionately disciplined, and this causes many Black students to get left behind in said system, while their white counterparts move ahead.
		<br /><br />Access to housing and credit, as well as the terms and location options associated with this access, also remain impacted by race.
		<br /><br />Black and/or "foreign"-sounding names are less likely to get call-backs for housing, medical, and/or other essential services, and are less likely to be admitted to quality educational institutions, receive call-backs for jobs, and more.
		<br /><br />Whites benefit directly and indirectly from all of this, and often contribute to the maintenance of this system, without even knowing it.
		<br /><br />Most of the capitalist class in America is also made up of white Americans. This means they have control of most of our major industries and institutions (this includes the government and greater state apparatus as well), and so the mechanisms that maintain and push white supremacy (control) throughout our greater society are extremely pervasive all throughout the country.</p>`

		response: `<p>If your ancestors wanted to live in America, maybe they should have learned some Indigenous/Native American languages (as well as some other things).
		<br /><br /><em>Okay, in all seriousness...</em>
		<br /><br />The demand for immigrants to speak English is an ethnocentric mandate for cultural assimilation into a system of multicultural intolerance (translation: this is a self-centered, selfish, and narcissistic demand to make, and it doesn't sit on fair, even grounds).
		<br /><br />The idea that penniless immigrants once came to this country and worked low-paying jobs to pull themselves up by their bootstraps to eventually reach equality of skills and income with "natives" is mostly false.
		<br /><br />During the Age of Mass Migration, long-term immigrants and natives held jobs at similar skill levels and climbed the occupational ladder at comparatively the same rate. Regardless of where they started, the gaps between immigrants and natives persisted throughout their lives. However, among the discrepancies of second generation citizens, children with less-foreign-sounding names who completed more years of schooling earned more, and were less likely to be unemployed as compared to their counterparts whose names sounded more foreign.
		<br /><br />It is likely that their foreign-sounding names exposed them to discrimination at school or on the job (see <a target="_blank" href="https://publicpolicy.stanford.edu/news/what-history-tells-us-about-assimilation-immigrants">here</a>). It hasn't been a lack of English language proficiency or assimilation that stalled upward mobility; the issue is that immigrants have been confronted with ethnocentrism and a socioeconomic system (Capitalism) in which upward mobility is a myth.
		<br /><br />Contrary to popular belief, America doesn't have an official language. America also has more native Spanish speakers than Spain itself. Not to mention most countries in the EU, Asia, and even Africa speak more than one language. Among the "developed" world, we are one of the only ones who speak only one language primarily. If anything, we should all be learning to use Spanish too, or French, and require it for the workplace as well as through high school.
		<br /><br />Studies show that bilingual children are better at problem-solving and creative tasks on average. America only stands to gain more by becoming multilingual.
		<br /><br />Not to mention there are plenty of dialects of other languages that are only spoken here! For example, Texan German is a thing because of migrants passing it down through generations. Louisiana French is another example of a language only spoken here. And at some point, it will be the same way for Spanish. That's not even counting AAVE (Black American English in all of its forms).

		keywords: [`racist`, `racism`, `fascist`, `fascism`],
		response: `<p>Technically, it is correct that anyone who doesn't defend marginalized people who look physically different than them, even when choosing to be neutral, is a racist in some way.
		<br /><br />The foundation of Western society is based upon the construction of whiteness, which led to white supremacy. Those who are not being oppressed by the system of whiteness are usually those who uphold this system, and deny that systemic racism exists. These people who consciously or unconsciously defend whiteness could be anyone from average working-class folks, to Liberals, to "Brocialists," to all-out reactionaries.
		<br /><br />To deconstruct whiteness, the foremost step is to acknowledge its existence, and to recognize that marginalized people are being oppressed by the specter of whiteness and white supremacy.
		<br /><br />It is <strong>crucial</strong> that all Leftists do this (otherwise, there is nothing to separate you from the racists).
		<br /><br />It is also worth noting that what often ends up happening is that many confuse "racist" as an identity with "racist" as an adjective.
		<br /><br />You don't have to be in the KKK to be racist, and you don't have to love Hitler to do something fascist.
		<br /><br />If something you said shows prejudice against a racial/ethnic group, or blankets them as a whole, it's probably racist, even if you don't think of yourself that way.
		<br /><br />This same thing applies with fascism.
		<br /><br />If you think all criminals should be put to death, that's something a fascist might say and it's a fascist thing to say, but that doesn't mean you would join an American "Fascist Party."
		<br /><br />In general, a lot of people are extremely sensitive to criticism or the possibility of feeling misrepresented; we are are not different in that regard. We don't like being told that we call everyone we don't like racist; it just so happens that when people do racist things and we call them on it, they don't like it.
		<br /><br />If you genuinely don't want to be considered a racist or fascist, then you should listen when someone calls something you did racist or fascist (at the minimum). We can, for the most part, tell when someone is being unreasonable, but you have to at least hear others out, especially if you want them to trust you, be your friend, and/or stay your friend.</p>`

		<br /><br />So while nationalism and race can be understood as a construct used by the bourgeoisie to divide and control the proletariat, it historically has not been that simple.
		<br /><br />People carry in them biases that they are not aware of, which can lead to us taking a principle that we technically consider universal, but then manifest due to our biases as exclusionary (not just in matters of race).
		<br /><br />Kant's moral philosophy, for example, posits a type of universal ethics, but his racism led him to apply a different moral standard to people he considered "inferior."
		<br /><br />There is also the practical aspect of Capitalism.
		<br /><br />White Socialists must see how working to help their comrades of other colors who are doubly burdened under Capitalism benefits them. This is not to say that humans should see other humans as mere means to their own ends, but if white people are interested in the liberation of humanity as a whole, they must also be concerned about their own particular liberation in part.

		response: `<p>If you don't see color, then you don't see the everyday struggles people go through because of color.
		<br /><br />Color-blind ideology is a post Civil Rights, socially-sanctioned form of racism. It advocates that since the Civil Rights Movement, structural inequalities are insignificant and suggests that the best way to end the remnants of discrimination that still exist is by asserting that race does not matter.
		<br /><br />Color-blindness accepts that racism is personal rather than societal and institutional. In not recognizing race, color-blindness not only denies stark differences in others in terms of income, wealth, poverty, and education, but also the salience of race in their own lives. When they participate in multiculturalist activities such as "New Age Native American spirituality" or the "local hip-hop scene," they remove and dilute racial and ethnic meanings and replace them with color-blind ones.
		<br /><br />More starkly, racism is typically viewed as isolated acts by ignorant people and extremist hate groups. Even institutional acts, such as racial profiling by police or the disproportionate impact of mortgage lending to Blacks and Latinos, are in the least calls for punishment of "bad apples," and at the most temporary regional media scandals rather than the recognition of systemic racism rooted in our societal framework.

		<span style="font-style:italic">"The citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States; and shall have the right of transit and sojourn in any State of this Confederacy, with their slaves and other property; and the right of property in said slaves shall not be thereby impaired."
		<br /><br />"No slave or other person held to service or labor in any State or Territory of the Confederate States, under the laws thereof, escaping or lawfully carried into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor; but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such slave belongs,. or to whom such service or labor may be due."
		<br /><br />"The Confederate States may acquire new territory; and Congress shall have power to legislate and provide governments for the inhabitants of all territory belonging to the Confederate States, lying without the limits of the several Sates; and may permit them, at such times, and in such manner as it may by law provide, to form States to be admitted into the Confederacy. In all such territory the institution of negro slavery, as it now exists in the Confederate States, shall be recognized and protected be Congress and by the Territorial government; and the inhabitants of the several Confederate States and Territories shall have the right to take to such Territory any slaves lawfully held by them in any of the States or Territories of the Confederate States."
		</span>
		<br /><br />A key component of the racist ideology of the Confederacy was that the enslavement and general oppression of Black people were necessary for the freedom of white people, including white people who did not own slaves. Even the poorest white person was better off than an enslaved Black person (or any Black person) in material terms. So non-slave-owning white people did have a real material interest of the subordination of Black people. This was compounded by the fact that a key myth of pro-slavery ideology was that slavery was necessary for white people to keep what they had, no matter how little that was.
		<br /><br />Additionally, it is perfectly possible to support something even if you don't participate in it. For instance, some believe that cannabis should be legal even though they don't use it. Similarly, the non-slave-owning ancestors of the person(s) asking this question could easily have supported slavery without actually owning anyone as an enslaved person.
		<br /><br />Finally, <a target="_blank" href="https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/1861stephens.asp">to quote Alexander Stephens, vice president of the Confederacy</a>:
		<br /><br />
		<span style="font-style:italic">"the new Constitution has put at rest forever all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institutions-African slavery as it exists among us-the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution.
		<br />[…]
		<br />Our new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and moral condition."

		<br /><br />Why one would argue that supporting the Confederacy was not "necessarily" about slavery when the Confederacy's leaders say the <strong>exact opposite</strong> is beyond us (but not really).</p>`

		<br/ >Town watches were always members of the community they patrolled with little-to-no special authority; they simply shared the responsibility of their community's safety as part of living in that community.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >Slave patrollers, meanwhile, were usually either paid a wage or more often a bounty for returned slaves, and had additional legal authorities beyond a normal citizen. When the Compromise of 1850 forced Fugitive Slave Laws on free states, slave patrollers gained even freedom to operate, as these laws not only criminalized aiding slaves, but also allowed them to kidnap and enslave any Black person anywhere in the country with only a signed affidavit from the alleged owner.

		response: `<p>Were the Irish ever slaves (period)?
		<br/ >
		<br/ >Yes, in the sense that people in what is now the Republic of Ireland enslaved each other and were abducted for forced labor by other peoples.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >Were the Irish ever slaves during the period the Atlantic slave trade provided labor to the United States of America and the colonies that became that country?
		<br/ >
		<br/ >No.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >"Slave" is a term with incredibly varied meaning depending on the locality and period. Conveniently, colonial and early U.S. documents leave a body of law collectively called "Slave Codes" that as a whole give a fairly clear legal definition of slavery. A slave was any black person, or less often an "American Indian," who was property by virtue of either legal sale, or who received the status of slave by being born to a slave. Persons were considered "black" if they had any provable African ancestry, and in most states only the children of female slaves were automatically slaves.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >There was a significant population of Irish people who immigrated under indenture. This is legally distinct from the chattel slavery discussed above, though it is another form of forced labor. Indenture is a form of labor equity in which a person promises their labor for a specific period of time in exchange for something else of value, such as an education in a trade, or in this case transatlantic passage. The indentured person would not only be required to labor for the period of indenture, but also have their mobility and legal rights restricted by the person holding their indenture. They could not travel, marry, or make other legal contracts without the permission of the indenture holder. Someone who paid for passage across the Atlantic through indenture was undertaking a legal status similar to an apprentice in a contemporary guild, who promised their labor for a set period in return for education in a craft and eventual recognition as a journeyman.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >The important distinction here is that while both indentured servitude and chattel slavery are forms of forced labor, a person under indenture was still legally a person. They had the same protections and rights under the law as any other person, other than those specifically superseded by the rights of the indenture holder. Any child they bore would be free, barring a choice to sell their indenture. A slave, meanwhile, is not considered (and treated as) a person. Their only legal presence is in a proof of purchase, similar to livestock. A slave could not marry any more than a plow horse could marry, and any children a slave might bear would also be slaves.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >When discussing the Irish there is one form of indenture that is especially notable: convict indenture.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >The British government sent numerous political and non-political prisoners to their colonies in North America and especially the Caribbean. A significant number of these individuals would have been Irish. While these people had significantly less choice in the matter, legally they were still serving an indenture, rather than slaves.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >They were legally still people and, after serving their specific period, they would be free.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >Indenture fell off drastically after the American Revolution. The nascent United States was not an attractive place for foreign business ventures, and so while immigration continued there was significantly less capital to invest, and less faith that the terms of indenture would be enforced. Slavery, meanwhile, was the backbone of much of the new country's economy, and would continue well after the 1807 Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >Forced labor is forced labor, but it is dishonest to compare the exploitation of the Irish and other poor immigrants faced during the USA's founding and early growth with the atrocities committed against Black and Indigenous/Native people during this same period.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >The Irish in America were often mistreated, but they were always legally people.

		<br/ >Because race can be used as a wedge to divide us, society is structured to benefit some people over others. That is, if the majority have some semblance of privelege over the minority, people will fight to retain that scrap of power.

These unfair, unequal, and exploitative outcomes are something we all face laboring for Capitalists who steal the surplus value of what we produce. But these negative outcomes are suffered disproportionately by people of color.

Starting approximately after WWII, the more "liberal" parts of the Democratic Party began to push for social reform, including racial reform. The southern Democrats were absolutely opposed to any reform. As early as 1948, some Democrats began to split off. Strom Thurmond, for example, left the party and became a "Dixiecrat."

		<br/ >
		<br/ >The most recent is by not being privy to Federal Housing Association (FHA) loans in the post World War II economic boom, Black people were prevented from accumulating capital in home ownership. This has a cumulative effect on Black wealth; if I give you a dollar to invest that accumulates value over time, and I don't lend another person that same dollar, when I come calling for that dollar in the future, you will still have more money than the other person. Now spread this out by many thousands of times (and over decades), and you can understand why white net worth is nearly 10 times Black net worth in the U.S.

		<br/ >Black communities being segregated and devalued by realtors meant that a Black-owned house was worth less, even if Black homeowners could get loans to build wealth.

This collapse was wildly damaging to the trust the Black community had in banking in general for decades, further preventing Black citizens from building wealth, as they did not have access to credit that other groups could take advantage of (especially other immigrant groups that are highlighted by Baradaran's research in the 1900s in <a target="_blank" href="https://theintercept.com/2017/10/11/intercepted-podcast-the-white-stuff/">this Intercepted podcast interview</a>).</p>`

		<br/ >
		<br/ >The flag people call the "Confederate flag" is actually the Battle Flag of the Army of Tennessee (a square version was used by General Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia). It was not popularized until it was flown in "historical films" such as <em>The Birth of a Nation</em>, which is what inspired the second Klu Klux Klan. It was also flown in <em>Gone with the Wind</em>, amongst other films, and then later associated with "Southern Pride" when Dixiecrats started using it to oppose the Civil Rights Movement during the 1960s. It was integrated into Georgia's state flag in 1956 as a reaction to <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> and was raised by University of Mississippi during protests against integrating schools (a way of saying you are legally allowed to attend, but you are not welcome).
		<br/ >
		<br/ >Southern heritage, pride, and race are interlinked, therefore the support for the Confederate flag is not just about racial attitudes or southern heritage alone and/or separately, but both.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >The flag has been used for discriminatory purposes. It represents more than the Civil War and its official endorsement of slavery. It also stands for a history of vocal resistance to racial and political equality for Blacks and other minorities.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >The intensity of the political fight over the Confederate flag has actually led some researchers to investigate the "heritage" versus "hate" debate.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >Researchers found that a widespread defense of the Confederate flag among whites has much more to do with racial concerns than with other aspects of southern heritage. (Reingold, Beth, and Richard S. Wike. "Confederate Symbols, Southern Identity, and Racial Attitudes: The Case of the Georgia State Flag." <em>Social Science Quarterly</em>, vol. 79, no. 3, 1998, pp. 568–580.).

		<br/ >The Confederate flag has been used by the KKK and other white supremacists who oppose racial justice up until today. Even government official George Wallace's 1963 "Segregation Forever" campaign included raising the Confederate flag.

		response: `<p><a target="_blank" href="https://plsonline.eku.edu/insidelook/brief-history-slavery-and-origins-american-policing">Policing institutions have their roots in slave patrols, so just keep that in mind when you tell Black people that they "have to listen to cops</a>."
		<br/ >
		<br/ >Cops may have a difficult job, but what seems more relevant is how dangerous it is (or isn't).
		<br/ >
		<br/ >Policing is not actually as dangerous in terms of fatalities per worker as numerous other jobs, including construction, logging, fishing, and agriculture. A lot of the cop fatalities we hear about are just car accidents and have nothing to do with intentional harm. Now, maybe certain kinds of cops skew those statistics in one direction or another, so let's grant for the sake of argument that some cops are routinely in extraordinary danger from potentially armed assailants.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >Even if that were the case, that still shouldn't be license to murder someone for, say, pulling their pants up contrary to instructions.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >If YOU (someone who isn't a cop) shot someone simply for "not following directions", there is a very large chance that you would be convicted of murder or manslaughter, as that is obviously insufficient justification for using lethal force.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >It's also not illegal to carry a firearm, and it certainly is not illegal to be suspected of possibly having a weapon. Cops are clearly capable of refraining from shooting people who they KNOW have a gun (consider how many mass shooters are arrested rather than killed). The mass shooters who are arrested mostly happen to be white, too, which doesn't seem like a coincidence.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >Or consider the Bundy standoff: a confrontation between around twenty armed ranchers and the bureau of land management that lasted several weeks and in which the ranchers had pointed weapons directly at the police; not even one single death resulted. These were people who the police KNEW were armed and could shoot them with a simple pull of the trigger and yet still, they didn't shoot them.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >How often have you been stopped by a cop with a drawn weapon barking instructions at you? Has it even happened once? For people in some communities, this is a frequent occurrence. Do you really think a life should end because on the fiftieth time someone was harassed by a cop, they didn't put their hands in the right place fast enough?
		<br/ >
		<br/ >Shooting someone for not following directions is putting a cop's convenience above the life of those they are supposedly sworn to "serve" and "protect" (we know this is not actually the role of the police historically). Now, sure, a standoff is a high pressure situation for a cop. And if it's a high pressure situation for a cop, it's that much higher for the one who has a gun pointed at them, especially considering how trigger-happy cops seem to be. Too often cops will unnecessarily escalate situations into such standoffs.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >Putting aside whether or not there should even be cops in the first place (there shouldn't be cops, by the way), maybe people who aren't really prepared to put their own life on the line, and who shoot people who aren't obviously a threat on the pretext that they are "afraid for their lif," shouldn't actually be cops. And maybe they should figure this out before they KILL SOMEONE. And maybe those who are dismissed because they killed someone in such a fashion shouldn't be hired to do police work in the next county over.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >You can argue that cops sometimes have a reason to use lethal force. But we constantly see cases where they use it without having sufficient justification and someone ends up dead. And it disproportionately happens to Black people because they are disproportionately targeted for various reasons, including where they live, implicit bias, spurious 911 calls, and simple, intentional profiling.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >It's easy to say that you have to follow a cop's directions if you're not regularly on the receiving end of such directions. If you are, have you always managed to perfectly comply, and can you really expect that of someone every time? What if the directions aren't even consistent, as has certainly happened before? If you're not regularly on the receiving end of such directions, maybe consider how your opinion might change if you were, because there are people for whom that is reality, and their lives matter just as much as yours.</p>`

		<br/ >
		<br/ >It is stark.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >In 2016, white families had the highest level of both median and mean family wealth: $171,000 and $933,700, respectively (figure 1). Black and Hispanic families have considerably less wealth than white families. Black families' median and mean net worth is less than 15 percent that of white families, at $17,600 and $138,200, respectively. Hispanic families' median and mean net worth was $20,700 and $191,200, respectively.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >You are reading this right.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >Median white family wealth is $171,000 vs. $17,600 for Blacks, and $20,700 for "Hispanics."
    <br/ >
		<br/ >Although most families do have some wealth, the number with zero or negative net worth (having debts that exceed assets) is nontrivial and varies by race/ethnicity. Nearly one in five black households has zero or negative net worth. The share of white households without any wealth is considerably smaller, at 9 percent. Hispanic and other households fall somewhere in between white and black families on this measure.
    <br/ >
		<br/ >For many families, the primary residence is an important component of the balance sheet. Well over half of white households are homeowners (73 percent), compared with just under half of black and Hispanic households (around 45 percent) and 54 percent of other households. Among homeowners, white households also hold considerably higher levels of equity in their homes. Mean net housing wealth (the value of the home, less any debts on the home) among homeowners is $215,800 among white families but only $94,400 among black families and $129,800 among Hispanic families. White homeowners hold more home equity, but housing accounts for only 32 percent of their total assets, compared with 37 to 39 percent for black and Hispanic homeowners.
    <br/ >
		<br/ >In addition to substantial heterogeneity within race/ethnicity groups by education, there are also large disparities across race/ethnicity groups for families with similar levels of education. Among households headed by someone with a college degree, net worth is substantially higher for white families than for the other three groups of families. The median net worth of college graduates in 2016 was $397,100 for white families, but well below $100,000 for black families and Hispanic families.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >This advantage is hard to see for most white people, and for various reasons (mostly because most white people spend most of their time around other white people of the same, or a similar, class, which isn't something unique).</p>`

		response: `<p>You are one step away from understanding the underlying cause of oppression, Capitalism.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >The underlying assumption of a race-only solution is that when racial groups are forced together (through law and regulation), they will work out their differences, i.e. the "melting pot." The antebellum South in the U.S. or apartheid South Africa are examples of intense, daily contact and deep familiarity between dominant and dominated individuals, where contact didn't diminish prejudice. Increased intergroup contact only works if the persons concerned are equal in status, have common goals, are not in competition, and if the contact is sanctioned by authority (Pettigrew, T. F., & Tropp, L. R. (2006). <em>A meta-analytic test of intergroup contact theory. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>, 90(5), 751-783.).
		<br/ >
		<br/ >Also, the outgroup suffers significant adverse effects during this process. Among many other issues, minorities and immigrants throughout the world suffer from worse health than host or majority populations and this problem has been observed in virtually all modern industrial societies. Part of this disparity is economic, but stress has been recognized as the crucial causal link between discrimination and health. The psychological and physical negative effects on the outgroup are significant. An exception to this rule is the "ethnic density" effect in which minorities and immigrants who live among members of their group are healthier than those who live among the majority population. Scientists have suggested that due to density, individuals have more and better social ties in homogeneous places and/or that ethnic density provides "buffering" against the social-psychological effects of discrimination (Boyer P., Firat R., van Leeuwen F., <em>Perspectives in Psychological Science</em>, 2015).
		<br/ >
		<br/ >Employment and education quotas alone as an attempt to increase contact with outgroups to solve racial issues is impractical and immoral. The cost of assimilation to the culture, identity, psychology, and health of the outgroup is significant. Under Capitalism, education and employment are competitive and stratified while diminishing prejudice only happens with equal status and no competition.

		response: `<p>Most people agree that compromise is essential in electoral politics and "politics" in general. The failure of politicians to compromise is often attributed to political polarization of our country – that is, for the Right and the Left to come to the middle. However, Gutmann and Thompson argue that there is an internal tension in political compromise in that the democratic process requires politicians both to resist compromise and to embrace it. Specifically, they point to the uncompromising mindset that characterizes campaigning which obstructs the search for desirable compromises:
		<br/ >
		<br/ ><a target="_blank" href="https://president.upenn.edu/meet-president/mindsets-political-compromise">"It is like an invasive species that spreads beyond its natural habitat as it roams from the campaign to the government."</a>
		<br/ >
		<br/ >Unfortunately, a lack of compromise favors the status quo. Media have pushed surveys faulting the Republicans for the lack of compromise mindset. In accordance with this, when looking at issues like the minimum wage, Liberals, whose position is typically to raise the wage, are more likely to compromise than Republicans. But the opposite is true on issues like tax reform, where Democrats are defending the status quo. As a result, the citizens are stuck with the status quo.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >Obviously, not much can change without some compromise, and major change needs major compromises. The solutions offered by the capitalist establishment, or at least the media as stenographers for the establishment, is <a target="_blank" href="https://theconversation.com/why-are-democratic-voters-more-approving-of-compromise-than-republicans-98828">"We get there only if constituents give legislators the freedom to compromise."</a>

		<br/ >
		<br/ >As usual, the attitude of the capitalist class isn't to change the two-party electoral system, adopt a different voting style, or some other governmental feature to make compromise and therefore change possible. Instead, their solution is to blame constituents for lack of compromise and politicians maintaining the status quo. </p>`

		<br/ >Despite "aid" from western countries, the amount of money flowing out of Africa to the West still dwarfs the amount coming in. This is due to regressive trade laws that mean that poor countries are required to open their markets to foreign goods (dumping).
		<br/ >
		<br/ >Since the mid 20th century, many African leaders who attempted to end this and develop their countries in the same way that western countries had (tax and spend, build public industry and services, etc.) have been couped and assassinated, mostly with help from the French, United Kingdom, and United States. (Sankara, Lumumba, Nkrumah, etc.).
		<br/ >
		<br/ >Yes there are corrupt people in those countries at the top, and this does not contradict the imperialism hypothesis, as they are required by the richer countries to make the money flow.</p>`

		response: `<p>Who are you referring to specifically?
		<br/ >
		<br/ >Right-wing violence is caused by people (such as the president) actively encouraging right-wing citizens to commit violent acts.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >Right-wing violence is caused by racist dog whistles that drive xenophobic hatred.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >Right-wing violence is caused by the spreading of lies about ethnic minorities.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >Right-wing violence is caused by the presence of Donald Trump on Infowars.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >Right-wing violence is caused by having anti-Semitic "political commentators" on television spreading disinformation.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >Right-wing violence is caused by the mainstreaming of fascist ideas.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >Aggressive protesting is what led to Richard Spencer declaring that "Antifa is winning."
		<br/ >
		<br/ >All of this said, though we know how the cookie typically crumbles, real revolutionary change does not necessitate violence.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >While many revolutions have been violent in the face of oppressive regimes, there have also been plenty of non-violent revolutions in history (Armenia just went through one in 2018). And the relationship between violence and revolution has been exaggerated.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >In the past, the dominant narrative has linked violence with rebellion because of their own military response to those who oppose oppression. Further, shocked by the threat to the existing order, the violence associated with rebellion and revolution has been distorted and greatly exaggerated by the hostile establishment and chroniclers who were the main sources of historical documentation.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >Revolutions have also been historically romanticized as violent in art, literature, and film to symbolically represent revolutionaries as heroic leaders willing to take up arms and to give up their lives as a demonstration of their commitment to the cause. It is in the hands of the capitalist class not to treat revolutionaries as irrational and bloodthirsty mobs, but to listen to reason and recognize them as politically organized, ideologically consistent, socially sanctioned movements of unarmed resistance. The claim that unarmed resisters are causing violence is the dominant narrative attempting to constrain, maintain, and impose control over the voice of the anti-racist, anti-capitalist opposition.</p>`

		keywords: [`good and bad`,`focus on`],
		response: `<p>The "bad" (all across the board and for all peoples) has long-term institutional consequences that need to be addressed; only focusing on the "good" won't help those issues get solved.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >Critical thinking and analyses matter, and we're particularly focused on critical analysis that is constructive; we are seeking and acting upon <strong>solutions</strong>.</p>`

		claim: `Men can't really be feminists.`,
		keywords: [`feminists`,`feminism`],
		response: `<p>Men have plenty to benefit from feminism.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >Under patriarchy, men are expected to play their associated gender roles as well, and can be written off or alienated if they fail to do so.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >Men who are in touch with their emotions, have a developed sense of empathy, who do not desire to enforce their will and dominate others, etc. are often mocked as "girly," "gay," or "weak."
		<br/ >
		<br/ >In addition to all of the ways that feminism will liberate women, it will liberate men as well.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >In fact, those men who have the most misdirected anger toward feminism would have the most to gain from it.
		<br/ >
		<br/ >The common perception of the most "valuable" men being physically strong, arrogant, uninterested in intellectual pursuits, and the other "Chad" stereotypes that are complained about so often, is reinforced by the very same patriarchy that feminists wish to abolish.</p>`
