      <title>Communism sounds good in theory, but it doesn&#39;t work in practice. Just look at countries like Venezuela. Look at what happened in Russia (the USSR).</title>

      <description>It is important to differentiate between a socialist/communist society, and a &amp;ldquo;socialist/communist&amp;rdquo; state (the latter does not exist beyond a mere label, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean much).
Venezuela is not a socialist country. It has State Capitalism and used oil money to fund welfare programs when oil production was high and prices were solid.
It&amp;rsquo;s also heavily sanctioned by foreign nations such as the United States.
The USSR also represented State Capitalism and faced several challenges, including a massive drought, and was actively worked against by foreign nations such as the United States.</description>
