      <description>Immigrants largely work jobs that Americans no longer want to work, largely in the agriculture sector. Immigrants (undocumented and documented) also pay into the tax system in a net gain for the U.S. treasury. Additionally, U.S. birthrates are low to the point we need immigrants to help fill the gap (see here and here).
States with high levels of immigrants also see a LOWERING in crime rates. Immigrants (both documented and undocumented) commit fewer crimes than native born residents (see here and here).</description>

      <title>Those refugees should fight for their own countries rather than flee and come here. They&#39;re cowards and just want job opportunities.</title>

      <description>Most of the refugees you&amp;rsquo;re referencing are probably refugees because of American foreign policy.
Telling people displaced and suffering because of policies put in place by your government to &amp;ldquo;stay and fight&amp;rdquo; is not only deeply inhumane, but nonsensical.
Also, who are these refugees supposed to fight for?
In a civil war, there are no obvious invading and defending forces.</description>
