      <description>Assuming this is a Liberal talking point directed toward white Leftists, maybe we should clarify some things&amp;hellip;
Socialists are supposed to fight against ALL kinds of oppression, and this means oppression along the lines of race, gender, and more.
Many amongst the white working class are struggling to get jobs, as well as a living wage and general financial security.
That same oppression is not only replicated on other races and genders, but we (as Black Americans, for example) also have our own particular struggles with racism (and others are dealing with even more struggles on top of this, like misogyny or transphobia, for example).</description>
