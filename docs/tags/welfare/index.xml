      <description>Most states require those on welfare to have a job or be job-searching, and the most effective welfare programs are those which give money to low-income workers.
The poor work harder than the average millionaire, taking sometimes two jobs just trying to avoid starvation and homelessness, and if they DO reach homelessness, no company will hire them since they will have no fixed address.
On the other hand, you have people who were born into wealthy families and haven&amp;rsquo;t worked hard for much of anything, or at best had a radically easier start than most others within society.</description>

      <description>Not all Black Americans are on welfare, so let&amp;rsquo;s try not to generalize here.
In fact, the greatest number of welfare recipients (by race) are white.
Let&amp;rsquo;s address this issue in relation to poor and working class Black Americans who are on welfare, though.
Giving financial support to the poor allows them to spend more of their income on the things they need. This is true even when cash is given with no strings attached, and no, poor folks do not spend whatever money is given to them on more drugs or alcohol, and studies indicate that if anything, financial support leads to less spending on drugs or alchohol.</description>

      <description>That&amp;rsquo;s like saying Neosporin and bandages applied to a gigantic arm gash in need of stitches were actually what caused the gash.
Welfare programs are a response to a problem, and our problem runs much deeper than what welfare programs alone can address.
We would argue that the reasons and circumstances that lead families to needing &amp;ldquo;welfare assistance&amp;rdquo; to begin with are the core problem (white supremacy and Capitalism are the two major &amp;ldquo;reasons&amp;rdquo;).</description>

      <title>Why do Black people just want handouts?</title>

      <description>Do you know any Black people personally?
This question implies that all Black people are poor.
Although there is a clear and major wealth gap, we as Black Americans have a class system too, for the record (and have had one for quite some time).
We can respond to this question two reasonable ways:
  Why do you think poor people just want &amp;ldquo;handouts&amp;rdquo; (as you call them)?
  Why are Black people disproportionately poor?</description>
