      <description>[This is not the flag of the Confederacy.
](https://goo.gl/images/MdCn2E)[This](https://goo.gl/images/CV9y7Z) was the first national flag, followed by &amp;ldquo;The Stainless Banner&amp;rdquo; (also know as The White Man&amp;rsquo;s Flag) and then finally &amp;ldquo;[.&amp;rdquo;
The flag people call the &amp;ldquo;Confederate flag&amp;rdquo; is actually the Battle Flag of the Army of Tennessee (a square version was used by General Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia). It was not popularized until it was flown in &amp;ldquo;historical films&amp;rdquo; such as The Birth of a Nation, which is what inspired the second Klu Klux Klan.</description>

      <title>They have freedom of speech, but disrespecting the national anthem, the flag, or the troops is not the way to protest.</title>

      <description>The national anthem literally has racist lyrics.
The troops (of all types of ethnicities) fight imperialist wars for oligarchs that don&amp;rsquo;t care about them.
The U.S. government has lied to its citizens to start the last six major wars on false pretenses.
The U.S. flag is not a symbol of hope, but of hate, to much of the world.
If this statement is really about folks like Colin Kaepernick&amp;hellip;
Kaepernick originally sat during the national anthem but started kneeling out of respect to the troops after reaching out to veterans.</description>
