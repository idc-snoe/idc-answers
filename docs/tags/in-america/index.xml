      <description>If your ancestors wanted to live in America, maybe they should have learned some Indigenous/Native American languages (as well as some other things).
Okay, in all seriousness&amp;hellip;
The demand for immigrants to speak English is an ethnocentric mandate for cultural assimilation into a system of multicultural intolerance (translation: this is a self-centered, selfish, and narcissistic demand to make, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t sit on fair, even grounds).
The idea that penniless immigrants once came to this country and worked low-paying jobs to pull themselves up by their bootstraps to eventually reach equality of skills and income with &amp;ldquo;natives&amp;rdquo; is mostly false.</description>
