      <description>It is true that the name of the slave-owning political party was the Democratic Party. After the Civil War, that party continued its exploitation of the former slaves through the Jim Crow system. The former slave owners made up the southern wing of the Democratic Party. Starting approximately after WWII, the more &amp;ldquo;liberal&amp;rdquo; parts of the Democratic Party began to push for social reform, including racial reform. The southern Democrats were absolutely opposed to any reform.</description>
