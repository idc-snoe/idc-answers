      <title>Racism is just a thing that exists, like potholes. You have to understand that you can&#39;t get rid of it. It&#39;s natural to fear the other, and people organize along racial lines for this reason.</title>

Who defines the &amp;ldquo;other&amp;rdquo; and how do they define it? And why is it considered &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;fear&amp;rdquo; those who are different? Perhaps the solution is making it so that there is no fear between different people, and bringing people together both socially and economically.
People organize around &amp;ldquo;racial&amp;rdquo; lines in America because of the racialized institutions in our society, as well as their colonialist, white supremacist roots.</description>
