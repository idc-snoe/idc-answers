      <description>You&amp;rsquo;d be had pressed to find someone who cared more about strangers than they cared about themselves and their immediate relatives and friends. Socialism can however be promoted based on purely selfish reasons if you so choose. If your friends or your family get sick or lose their jobs, do you want to be the one who has to take care of them and bear that financial burden? Probably not - so why not support a free and universal healthcare system, or a better unemployment system.</description>
