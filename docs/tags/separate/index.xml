      <description>We can not just advocate for ending Capitalist oppression, but we can also put specific ways in which the Black community is oppressed in the spotlight, while advocating for equality.
Not having that additional input from a marginalized community might end up perpetuating oppression from society, even if the socialist revolution succeeds.
This might be independent from actual policy. Maybe a Socialist leader is not antisemitic or racist, but without educating the people, any socialist policy&amp;rsquo;s effect will be dampened.</description>
