      <title>My ancestors fought for the Confederacy but they were too poor to own slaves, so how are you gonna tell me that they were fighting for slavery? The civil war wasn&#39;t about slavery.</title>

      <title>The Confederate flag is just Southern pride; it&#39;s our heritage. We&#39;re not racist.</title>

      <description>[This is not the flag of the Confederacy.
](https://goo.gl/images/MdCn2E)[This](https://goo.gl/images/CV9y7Z) was the first national flag, followed by &amp;ldquo;The Stainless Banner&amp;rdquo; (also know as The White Man&amp;rsquo;s Flag) and then finally &amp;ldquo;[.&amp;rdquo;
The flag people call the &amp;ldquo;Confederate flag&amp;rdquo; is actually the Battle Flag of the Army of Tennessee (a square version was used by General Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia). It was not popularized until it was flown in &amp;ldquo;historical films&amp;rdquo; such as The Birth of a Nation, which is what inspired the second Klu Klux Klan.</description>
