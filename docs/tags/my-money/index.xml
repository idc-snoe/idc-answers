      <description>Most states require those on welfare to have a job or be job-searching, and the most effective welfare programs are those which give money to low-income workers.
The poor work harder than the average millionaire, taking sometimes two jobs just trying to avoid starvation and homelessness, and if they DO reach homelessness, no company will hire them since they will have no fixed address.
On the other hand, you have people who were born into wealthy families and haven&amp;rsquo;t worked hard for much of anything, or at best had a radically easier start than most others within society.</description>
