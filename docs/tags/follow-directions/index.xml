      <title>Cops have a hard job, and how do they know if some person is unarmed? If someone didn&#39;t follow directions, I&#39;d probably shoot them too. You have to listen to cops.</title>

      <description>Policing institutions have their roots in slave patrols, so just keep that in mind when you tell Black people that they &amp;ldquo;have to listen to cops.&amp;rdquo;
Cops may have a difficult job, but what seems more relevant is how dangerous it is (or isn&amp;rsquo;t).
Policing is not actually as dangerous in terms of fatalities per worker as numerous other jobs, including construction, logging, fishing, and agriculture. A lot of the cop fatalities we hear about are just car accidents and have nothing to do with intentional harm.</description>
