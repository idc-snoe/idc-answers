      <description>Ignoring the problematic media portrayal of gulags, [capitalist countries had mastered concentration camps long before soviet gulags[(https://jacobinmag.com/2017/05/uk-concentration-camps-wwii-poland-internment-prisoners).
Over 20,000 children died of starvation and diseash in British concentration camps during the second Boer War (1899-1902) alone and thousands more suffered in compounds like the Lancaster Concentration Camp which saw Germain civilians be attacked with a bayonet charge to restore order.
Even today, for-profit prison systems in capitalist countries effectively enslave large portions of the population while exploiting their labor for as little as 23 cents an hour while producing items like produce for Walmart, uniforms for McDonald&amp;rsquo;s, and missiles for Lockheed Martin.</description>
