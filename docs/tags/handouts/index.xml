      <description>Not all Black Americans are on welfare, so let&amp;rsquo;s try not to generalize here.
In fact, the greatest number of welfare recipients (by race) are white.
Let&amp;rsquo;s address this issue in relation to poor and working class Black Americans who are on welfare, though.
Giving financial support to the poor allows them to spend more of their income on the things they need. This is true even when cash is given with no strings attached, and no, poor folks do not spend whatever money is given to them on more drugs or alcohol, and studies indicate that if anything, financial support leads to less spending on drugs or alchohol.</description>

      <description>Do you know any Black people personally?
This question implies that all Black people are poor.
Although there is a clear and major wealth gap, we as Black Americans have a class system too, for the record (and have had one for quite some time).
We can respond to this question two reasonable ways:
  Why do you think poor people just want &amp;ldquo;handouts&amp;rdquo; (as you call them)?
  Why are Black people disproportionately poor?</description>
