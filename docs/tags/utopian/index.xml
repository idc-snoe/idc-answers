      <description>We strongly disagree, but if what we are aiming to accomplish is merely &amp;ldquo;utopian&amp;rdquo; in your eyes (it&amp;rsquo;s not in ours), that means you can at least see the good in it.
You have one life; maybe help us create a new, &amp;ldquo;realistic&amp;rdquo; version of what we are aiming towards.
If the problem is that it&amp;rsquo;s not realistic, then join the discussion and help ground us. None of us here are dedicated to having our heads up our asses; we just want a better world than the one we are in.</description>
