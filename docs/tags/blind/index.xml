      <description>If you don&amp;rsquo;t see color, then you don&amp;rsquo;t see the everyday struggles people go through because of color.
Color-blind ideology is a post Civil Rights, socially-sanctioned form of racism. It advocates that since the Civil Rights Movement, structural inequalities are insignificant and suggests that the best way to end the remnants of discrimination that still exist is by asserting that race does not matter.
Color-blindness accepts that racism is personal rather than societal and institutional.</description>

      <title>Not EVERYTHING is about race. And isn&#39;t pointing out race just being racist, encouraging racism, or dividing us further?</title>

      <description>In an ideal, post-racial world, yes.
But we do not live in this ideal, post-racial world.
We must address the very real, systemic racism together in order to work through the divisions and bring everyone onto the same page of action.
Furthermore, it is worth keeping in mind that Black Americans are not responsible for &amp;ldquo;race.&amp;rdquo; It is &amp;ldquo;white&amp;rdquo; people (Europeans) who created and developed &amp;ldquo;race&amp;rdquo; as a social construct.</description>
