      <description>&amp;ldquo;Ways to be offended&amp;rdquo; is a common phrase among Conservatives reacting to &amp;ldquo;Political Correctness.&amp;rdquo; It is an example of how mainstream media exploits public fear and hatred as a social control mechanism.
There are various theories about the origins of the actual phrase, but until the 1980s in the United States, it was usually used ironically exclusively by the Left. It didn&amp;rsquo;t surface in mainstream American culture until 1990 when Richard Bernstein used it in a New York Times article to describe &amp;ldquo;unofficial ideology of the university .</description>

      <description>Is the &amp;ldquo;politically correct&amp;rdquo; take something that you agree with deep down, but are too lazy to actually reflect in your own actions and/or words?
We understand that we are all conditioned and therefore carrying with us negative ideas or perspectives rooted in our childhoods or traditions, but it is on all of us to actively work to be better people.
Having some room to breathe and not overthink things is important, but if your words are reflecting negative ideas or sentiments, even though your intentions might not be in a bad place, it might be worth it to pause and reflect on what it is that you are promoting, and asking yourself if this is something that is in line with who you want to be as a human being.</description>

      <description>What happened to free speech in the context of &amp;ldquo;PC culture&amp;rdquo; is, at its core, dishonest.
The &amp;ldquo;free speech&amp;rdquo; argument displays a political spin of the group that has its hands on it.
It is used as a political tool rather than a concept to keep the combatants in the political arena honest.
There are no official rules, guidelines, or laws in favor of political correctness and against offensive speech.</description>
