      <description>Technically, it is correct that anyone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t defend marginalized people who look physically different than them, even when choosing to be neutral, is a racist in some way.
The foundation of Western society is based upon the construction of whiteness, which led to white supremacy. Those who are not being oppressed by the system of whiteness are usually those who uphold this system, and deny that systemic racism exists. These people who consciously or unconsciously defend whiteness could be anyone from average working-class folks, to Liberals, to &amp;ldquo;Brocialists,&amp;rdquo; to all-out reactionaries.</description>
