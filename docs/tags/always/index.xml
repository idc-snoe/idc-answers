      <description>Because the color of your skin predicts many of the outcomes you will experience in your life.
Where racists will point to these facts and, incorrectly, claim these are essential and immutable qualities of the races, Socialists understand that these material conditions are caused by institutions of power, both formal and informal, that exist to support some over others (principally, the ruling class over the working class).
Because race can be used as a wedge to divide us, society is structured to benefit some people over others.</description>
