      <description>MLK would most likely be proud of BLM for spotlighting police brutality and putting discussions about systemic racism at the forefront of our national sociopolitical dialogue.
He probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a fan of their Liberal (or &amp;ldquo;moderate&amp;rdquo;) co-optation, or their glaring lack of economic policy and labor organizing strategies.
You just seem like the exact type of &amp;ldquo;white moderate&amp;rdquo; MLK was talking about, though.</description>

      <title>MLK was never this divisive. Martin Luther King was actually anti-identity politics, and he would have been a Republican today.</title>

      <description>MLK was literally murdered for his politics. He was also critical of the capitalist system starting in his 20s, so he would not be a Republican today.
MLK did not belong to or identify with either major political party, and at times called out both parties for having failed and betrayed Black Americans. His father was a Republican prior to the Civil Rights Movement, as were many Black Americans, for this was during a time when the Republican Party was seen as the Party of Lincoln.</description>
