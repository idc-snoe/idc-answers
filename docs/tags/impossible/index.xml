      <description>Equality is not &amp;ldquo;sameness.&amp;rdquo;
Equality acknowledges differences between people, but does not support distinctions such as race and gender as a basis for subjection.
Acknowledging differences is at the core of the concept of equality. In order for us to treat each other as equals, it is necessary that we first acknowledge and value our differences.
Treating people as equals is different than treating them the same. For instance, in education, giving students the same amounts of instruction, lessons, and identical learning materials is different than providing students with the necessary resources to reach educational goals and achieve academic success.</description>
