      <description>This is called tone policing.
This implies that rhetoric matters more to you than actual ideas.
There is a time for a discussion of optics, but this is not usually appropriate over matters dealing with race and/or class.
One should judge ideas based off of what they are, not by how they are presented, although presentation and clarity play a significant role in our communications.
Obviously saying &amp;ldquo;white people are racist&amp;rdquo; (for example) is so simplistic that it&amp;rsquo;s almost useless, but if one knows how to read these statements and the intent behind them, then there is no problem in most cases.</description>
