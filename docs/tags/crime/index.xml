      <description>What you&amp;rsquo;re trying to imply here is that Black Americans are genetically predisposed to be more violent, which is kind of ironic given Black Americans are on U.S. soil today because we were violently extracted from Africa and violently enslaved for centuries, primarily by &amp;ldquo;white&amp;rdquo; people (Europeans). This is race science hogwash.</description>

      <description>Immigrants largely work jobs that Americans no longer want to work, largely in the agriculture sector. Immigrants (undocumented and documented) also pay into the tax system in a net gain for the U.S. treasury. Additionally, U.S. birthrates are low to the point we need immigrants to help fill the gap (see here and here).
States with high levels of immigrants also see a LOWERING in crime rates. Immigrants (both documented and undocumented) commit fewer crimes than native born residents (see here and here).</description>
