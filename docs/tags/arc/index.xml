      <description>&amp;ldquo;Morality&amp;rdquo; is perceived differently all over the world, and has changed throughout history. But not in any specific direction.
&amp;ldquo;Morality&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t easily quantifiable over time, as the moral axioms have changed. What is perceived by us as immoral today, was considered perfectly fine by people a century ago.
The definition of &amp;ldquo;justice&amp;rdquo; keeps changing, and so the &amp;ldquo;moral arc&amp;rdquo; tends to bend to justify ruling class domination.</description>
