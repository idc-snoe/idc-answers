      <description>Certainly you aren&amp;rsquo;t trying to imply that there is something inherent about black people that makes them predisposed to failure.
You just answered your own question.
Under a capitalist system, the incentive for any nation-state (and most private interests) isn&amp;rsquo;t to &amp;ldquo;help&amp;rdquo; African nations become &amp;ldquo;developed&amp;rdquo; for the benefit of Africans, but rather for the benefit of corporations (and more broadly, the global capitalist class) so that they may be in a better position to exploit the resources that Africa has to offer.</description>
