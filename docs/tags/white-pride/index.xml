      <description>&amp;ldquo;White&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t a nationality, let alone an ethnic category - it is an extremely broad grouping based strictly upon skin color and other physical features, and a grouping so broad that one is basically saying that they are proud to not be an ethnic minority in saying that they are &amp;ldquo;proud to be white.&amp;rdquo;
There is no culture of &amp;ldquo;whiteness.&amp;rdquo;
You cannot conflate the achievements of the Scandinavians with those of the Italians, and the achievements of the Italians with those of the British, and so on and so forth.</description>
