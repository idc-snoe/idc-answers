      <description>Eugene Debs wasn&amp;rsquo;t right about everything, but he was certainly right about a lot.
We&amp;rsquo;ll leave you with this quote from him that is a core part of our philosophy:
&amp;ldquo;While there is a lower class, I am in it.
While there is a criminal element, I am of it.
And while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.&amp;rdquo;</description>
