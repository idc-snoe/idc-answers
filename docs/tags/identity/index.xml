      <description>Identity politics is not synonymous with race reductionism (reducing everything to race).
We think it&amp;rsquo;s important that we differentiate between Liberal identity politics, and Leftist identity politics. The former is a tool used by (Neo)Liberals to keep poor and working-class people divided, while the latter is about ensuring less-represented voices and concerns get heard in an international movement to dismantle Capitalism.
If anything, class reductionism has &amp;ldquo;ruined&amp;rdquo; the (actual) Left while Liberals (not Leftists) with no conception of an anti-racist and anti-capitalist future have co-opted inherently anticapitalist concepts rooted in identity.</description>
