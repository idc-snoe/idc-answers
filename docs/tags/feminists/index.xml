      <description>Men have plenty to benefit from feminism.
Under patriarchy, men are expected to play their associated gender roles as well, and can be written off or alienated if they fail to do so.
Men who are in touch with their emotions, have a developed sense of empathy, who do not desire to enforce their will and dominate others, etc. are often mocked as &amp;ldquo;girly,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;gay,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;weak.&amp;rdquo;
In addition to all of the ways that feminism will liberate women, it will liberate men as well.</description>
