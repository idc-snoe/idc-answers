      <title>Those refugees should fight for their own countries rather than flee and come here. They&#39;re cowards and just want job opportunities.</title>

      <description>Most of the refugees you&amp;rsquo;re referencing are probably refugees because of American foreign policy.
Telling people displaced and suffering because of policies put in place by your government to &amp;ldquo;stay and fight&amp;rdquo; is not only deeply inhumane, but nonsensical.
Also, who are these refugees supposed to fight for?
In a civil war, there are no obvious invading and defending forces.
