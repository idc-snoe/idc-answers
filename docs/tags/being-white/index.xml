      <description>This is a good opportunity to talk about the way that your position in life shapes the way you see things.
You don&amp;rsquo;t notice the ways that you benefit from being white because society has been (by and large) designed by people like you with you in mind. Bad things are less likely to happen to you because you are white â€“ that isn&amp;rsquo;t to say that bad things couldn&amp;rsquo;t happen to you in spite of you being white, of course.</description>
