      <description>What do you mean when you say &amp;ldquo;identity politics&amp;rdquo; exactly?
Are you referring to race reductionism (people who reduce everything to race)?
Are you referring to people with different backgrounds moving in self-determination?
We think it&amp;rsquo;s important that we differentiate between Liberal identity politics, and Leftist identity politics. The former is a tool used by (Neo)Liberals to keep poor and working-class people divided, while the latter is about ensuring less-represented voices and concerns get heard in an international movement to dismantle Capitalism.</description>

      <description>Ignoring the struggles of marginalized people is exactly what Trump and fascists would want you to do, no?
