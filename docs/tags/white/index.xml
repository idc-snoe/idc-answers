      <description>Because white people make up a bigger part of the U.S. population; there are about three times as many white people in America than there are black people, so obviously they will be the majority of pretty much everything.
If you look at the rates and not just the numbers, though, black people get shot by police at a higher rate.
Black people make up 12 to 13 percent of the population but 31% of the police shooting victims.</description>

      <description>Not only is there not any real unitary &amp;ldquo;white&amp;rdquo; history, but there is something to be said here about the utility of history (as a subject in schools, for example).
There is a common assumption that only the history of one&amp;rsquo;s own culture should be taught, perhaps with a little international &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo; stacked on top that either does not take into account what can be learned from the history of other cultures, or simply assumes one&amp;rsquo;s own culture is the most important.</description>
