      <description>What a, dare we say&amp;hellip; privileged position to take.
This stance completely overlooks the reality of voter suppression that Black Americans and other ethnic minorities have had to deal with.
Gerrymandering, social media manipulation, ex-offenders being indefinitely stripped of voting rights, and all forms of voter suppression are a far bigger threat to our semi-democratic institutions (what many call &amp;ldquo;democracy,&amp;rdquo; although we understand that Liberal representative &amp;ldquo;democracy&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t democracy at all) than Russian influence over our elections.</description>
