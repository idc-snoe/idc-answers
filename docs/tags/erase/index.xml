      <description>Not only is there not any real unitary &amp;ldquo;white&amp;rdquo; history, but there is something to be said here about the utility of history (as a subject in schools, for example).
There is a common assumption that only the history of one&amp;rsquo;s own culture should be taught, perhaps with a little international &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo; stacked on top that either does not take into account what can be learned from the history of other cultures, or simply assumes one&amp;rsquo;s own culture is the most important.</description>
