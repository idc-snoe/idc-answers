      <description>What happened to free speech in the context of &amp;ldquo;PC culture&amp;rdquo; is, at its core, dishonest.
The &amp;ldquo;free speech&amp;rdquo; argument displays a political spin of the group that has its hands on it.
It is used as a political tool rather than a concept to keep the combatants in the political arena honest.
There are no official rules, guidelines, or laws in favor of political correctness and against offensive speech.</description>
