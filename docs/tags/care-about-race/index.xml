      <description>What is the source for this claim?
Black American people have been speaking out about racial issues for centuries now (our ancestors were brought here as enslaved Africans, so this won&amp;rsquo;t change anytime soon).
This isn&amp;rsquo;t even debatable.
Certainly you don&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;speak for&amp;rdquo; all Black people, do you?
