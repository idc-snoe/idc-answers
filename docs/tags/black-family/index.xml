      <description>That&amp;rsquo;s like saying Neosporin and bandages applied to a gigantic arm gash in need of stitches were actually what caused the gash.
Welfare programs are a response to a problem, and our problem runs much deeper than what welfare programs alone can address.
We would argue that the reasons and circumstances that lead families to needing &amp;ldquo;welfare assistance&amp;rdquo; to begin with are the core problem (white supremacy and Capitalism are the two major &amp;ldquo;reasons&amp;rdquo;).</description>
