      <description>Because white people make up a bigger part of the U.S. population; there are about three times as many white people in America than there are black people, so obviously they will be the majority of pretty much everything.
If you look at the rates and not just the numbers, though, black people get shot by police at a higher rate.
Black people make up 12 to 13 percent of the population but 31% of the police shooting victims.</description>
