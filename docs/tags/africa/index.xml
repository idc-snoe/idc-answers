      <title>Black people should just be grateful that they&#39;re here. Don&#39;t they know how much worse they&#39;d have it in Africa?</title>

      <description>Telling someone to be grateful for their own abduction is absurd, especially when there are so many obvious problems now (colonialism&amp;rsquo;s effects in modern day Africa would still affect Blacks if they were &amp;ldquo;left&amp;rdquo;).

      <description>And European settlers &amp;ldquo;belonged&amp;rdquo; in Europe by your logic. But guess what?
They colonized America, killed off a majority of the Indigenous population, enslaved our ancestors, designed systems that have us disproportionately enslaved today, and now their descendants think that the land has always been their own.
Oh, and if someone is born and raised in a particular region of the world, then they are from said region of the world.</description>

      <title>Why is Africa still so undeveloped after decades of aid from both governments and private charities? What&#39;s the matter with them?</title>

      <description>Certainly you aren&amp;rsquo;t trying to imply that there is something inherent about black people that makes them predisposed to failure.
You just answered your own question.
Under a capitalist system, the incentive for any nation-state (and most private interests) isn&amp;rsquo;t to &amp;ldquo;help&amp;rdquo; African nations become &amp;ldquo;developed&amp;rdquo; for the benefit of Africans, but rather for the benefit of corporations (and more broadly, the global capitalist class) so that they may be in a better position to exploit the resources that Africa has to offer.</description>
