      <title>I never did anything to anyone. I&#39;m not responsible for what my ancestors did. I shouldn&#39;t have to pay for America&#39;s racist history. You shouldn&#39;t have to pay for the crimes of ancestors you never met.</title>

      <description>You didn&amp;rsquo;t cross the Delaware river either.
You didn&amp;rsquo;t fight against the British in the Revolutionary War and you didn&amp;rsquo;t free the slaves, yet despite all that, we&amp;rsquo;d bet you&amp;rsquo;re proud to be an &amp;ldquo;American.&amp;rdquo;
If you&amp;rsquo;re going to take pride in your ancestors&amp;rsquo; accomplishments, it&amp;rsquo;s hypocritical to not take responsibility for their crimes.
Furthermore, you also directly benefit from the things your ancestors have done. In the same way that your grandparents being rich has an effect on your life, even if you don&amp;rsquo;t feel personally responsible, the racism of your ancestors has directly benefited you in ways you cannot deny or fathom without some reflection.</description>

      <description>Not only is there not any real unitary &amp;ldquo;white&amp;rdquo; history, but there is something to be said here about the utility of history (as a subject in schools, for example).
There is a common assumption that only the history of one&amp;rsquo;s own culture should be taught, perhaps with a little international &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo; stacked on top that either does not take into account what can be learned from the history of other cultures, or simply assumes one&amp;rsquo;s own culture is the most important.</description>
