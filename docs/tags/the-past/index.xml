      <description>First of all, the year is 2020 and &amp;ldquo;slavery&amp;rdquo; is still ongoing.
Check out the 13th Amendment:
_Amendment XIII
Section 1.
Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.
Section 2.
Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation._
Take note of this phrase: &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; except as a punishment for crime&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;</description>
