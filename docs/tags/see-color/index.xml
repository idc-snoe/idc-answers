      <description>If you don&amp;rsquo;t see color, then you don&amp;rsquo;t see the everyday struggles people go through because of color.
Color-blind ideology is a post Civil Rights, socially-sanctioned form of racism. It advocates that since the Civil Rights Movement, structural inequalities are insignificant and suggests that the best way to end the remnants of discrimination that still exist is by asserting that race does not matter.
Color-blindness accepts that racism is personal rather than societal and institutional.</description>

      <title>I don&#39;t see color. By seeing racism in all things, you&#39;re perpetuating it. If race is a construct why should we even acknowledge racism?</title>

      <description>Recognizing race as a social construct does not make race less &amp;ldquo;real.&amp;rdquo;
Money is a social construct, but you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t burn your wallet, right?
Scientists generally do not recognize &amp;ldquo;race&amp;rdquo; as biologically meaningful, but race is socially real, not biologically real.
Race as a social construct is contingent on social groups and their collective agreement and acceptance of the constructions.
Race is something that is real in society, and that shapes the way we see ourselves and others.</description>
