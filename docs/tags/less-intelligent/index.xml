      <description>Black people (in the racial sense) aren&amp;rsquo;t inherently less intelligent than other races, and to posit otherwise would be entirely unscientific, because there is no scientific basis for such a claim. Black people, just like all other people, are shaped largely by their environments.
Now if you&amp;rsquo;d like to discuss the environments Black people have been shaped by, that&amp;rsquo;s another (much longer) discussion.
You could start with the fact that our ancestors came to the U.</description>
