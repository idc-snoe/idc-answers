      <description>Were the Irish ever slaves (period)?
Yes, in the sense that people in what is now the Republic of Ireland enslaved each other and were abducted for forced labor by other peoples.
Were the Irish ever slaves during the period the Atlantic slave trade provided labor to the United States of America and the colonies that became that country?
No.
&amp;ldquo;Slave&amp;rdquo; is a term with incredibly varied meaning depending on the locality and period.</description>
