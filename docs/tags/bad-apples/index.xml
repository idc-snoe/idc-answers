      <description>Cops already have overwhelmingly positive media coverage.
For example, news outlets typically says things like &amp;ldquo;suspect was killed in a police-involved shooting&amp;rdquo; rather than &amp;ldquo;police shot an unarmed and compliant civilian.&amp;rdquo;
It&amp;rsquo;s actually a vanishingly rare circumstance where the news gives police brutality fair coverage; the reason it stands out in your mind is because it&amp;rsquo;s such an unusual happening.
If the news reported on police brutality (and the corruption that follows in allowing such officers to go free without meaningful consequence) in an unbiased manner, it would take wall-to-wall coverage every day of the year to address the scope of this problem.</description>
