      <description>&amp;ldquo;All lives matter&amp;rdquo; is a clever trick.
Imagine getting shot in the leg and saying that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to lose your leg, and someone who is not wounded walking up and saying, &amp;ldquo;No one wants to lose their arm either.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;No one wants to lose their arm&amp;rdquo; is a pretty reasonable position if you don&amp;rsquo;t consider anything else.
But if you consider the circumstances and the context, it is actually a nonsense thing to state.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;d like to hope that we could all one day live in a society in which empathy is extended to all peoples, even those who are not a part of your immediate ethnic/racial group.</description>
