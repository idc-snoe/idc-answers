      <title>I totally agree on race issues, because it&#39;s always divided us, which is why I think the economic stuff is just gonna divide us more. We need to unify behind achievable goals to end racism like leveraging corporate partnerships to encourage diverse hiring!</title>

      <description>You are one step away from understanding the underlying cause of oppression, Capitalism.
The underlying assumption of a race-only solution is that when racial groups are forced together (through law and regulation), they will work out their differences, i.e. the &amp;ldquo;melting pot.&amp;rdquo; The antebellum South in the U.S. or apartheid South Africa are examples of intense, daily contact and deep familiarity between dominant and dominated individuals, where contact didn&amp;rsquo;t diminish prejudice.</description>
