      <description>What you&amp;rsquo;re trying to imply here is that Black Americans are genetically predisposed to be more violent, which is kind of ironic given Black Americans are on U.S. soil today because we were violently extracted from Africa and violently enslaved for centuries, primarily by &amp;ldquo;white&amp;rdquo; people (Europeans). This is race science hogwash.</description>
