      <description>The &amp;ldquo;trouble&amp;rdquo; is already here and more &amp;ldquo;trouble&amp;rdquo; is coming.
People are starving or working double jobs without resting to just barely not starve.
People are being killed because of their skin color, sex, gender, or age.
People have to work in shit they never really wanted to do because otherwise they&amp;rsquo;ll be left in worse conditions than a family goldfish.
The only people to have &amp;ldquo;things made worse&amp;rdquo; for are the rich, privileged few, which are in their position thanks to how bad life is for the rest.</description>
