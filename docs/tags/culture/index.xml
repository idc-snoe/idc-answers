      <title>Blacks are great, but they only have themselves and their culture to blame when they get shot by cops. I support Black rights, but when they have songs about killing cops, don&#39;t blame them when they shoot back.</title>

      <description>Policing was anti-Black long before rap music was invented.
The roots of modern policing exist not in town watches, as is often claimed, but in slave patrols.
Town watches were always members of the community they patrolled with little-to-no special authority; they simply shared the responsibility of their community&amp;rsquo;s safety as part of living in that community.
Slave patrollers, meanwhile, were usually either paid a wage or more often a bounty for returned slaves, and had additional legal authorities beyond a normal citizen.</description>
