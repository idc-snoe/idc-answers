      <description>&amp;ldquo;All lives matter&amp;rdquo; is a clever trick.
Imagine getting shot in the leg and saying that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to lose your leg, and someone who is not wounded walking up and saying, &amp;ldquo;No one wants to lose their arm either.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;No one wants to lose their arm&amp;rdquo; is a pretty reasonable position if you don&amp;rsquo;t consider anything else.
But if you consider the circumstances and the context, it is actually a nonsense thing to state.</description>

      <description>This all depends on what you mean when you say &amp;ldquo;racist.&amp;rdquo; Usually when someone says this, what they&amp;rsquo;re really trying to do is equate prejudices expressed or acted upon by Black Americans with the racism and prejudice of &amp;ldquo;white&amp;rdquo; Americans. This leaves out centuries of historical context, as well as the context of our present circumstances. Black Americans only make up 12.6% of the U.S. population and &amp;ldquo;white&amp;rdquo; Americans hold most of the institutional power, so it&amp;rsquo;s worth thinking about the big picture here.</description>

      <description>What you&amp;rsquo;re trying to imply here is that Black Americans are genetically predisposed to be more violent, which is kind of ironic given Black Americans are on U.S. soil today because we were violently extracted from Africa and violently enslaved for centuries, primarily by &amp;ldquo;white&amp;rdquo; people (Europeans). This is race science hogwash.</description>

      <description>Telling someone to be grateful for their own abduction is absurd, especially when there are so many obvious problems now (colonialism&amp;rsquo;s effects in modern day Africa would still affect Blacks if they were &amp;ldquo;left&amp;rdquo;).</description>

      <description>Policing was anti-Black long before rap music was invented.
The roots of modern policing exist not in town watches, as is often claimed, but in slave patrols.
Town watches were always members of the community they patrolled with little-to-no special authority; they simply shared the responsibility of their community&amp;rsquo;s safety as part of living in that community.
Slave patrollers, meanwhile, were usually either paid a wage or more often a bounty for returned slaves, and had additional legal authorities beyond a normal citizen.</description>

      <description>How do you think &amp;ldquo;Blacks&amp;rdquo; are going about it exactly? And how are you involved in helping us achieve what you &amp;ldquo;agree&amp;rdquo; with in your own personal life? Given our history and experiences in this country, how could you not understand and empathize with how different Black Americans are trying to respond to the various forms of oppression levied against us on a daily basis by our inherently racist economic system and government?</description>

      <description>If you are against racism, you should look into how colonialists created &amp;ldquo;race,&amp;rdquo; and how Capitalists utilize &amp;ldquo;race&amp;rdquo; so that workers go against their own interests and profits can be maximized.
Ever-increasing profits is an unsustainable goal and, under Capitalism, the majority must eventually give from the bottom so that a select few can take from the top.
This is where racism (and race) becomes the Capitalist&amp;rsquo;s favorite tool.

      <description>If you don&amp;rsquo;t see color, then you don&amp;rsquo;t see the everyday struggles people go through because of color.
Color-blind ideology is a post Civil Rights, socially-sanctioned form of racism. It advocates that since the Civil Rights Movement, structural inequalities are insignificant and suggests that the best way to end the remnants of discrimination that still exist is by asserting that race does not matter.
Color-blindness accepts that racism is personal rather than societal and institutional.</description>

      <description>Recognizing race as a social construct does not make race less &amp;ldquo;real.&amp;rdquo;
Money is a social construct, but you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t burn your wallet, right?
Scientists generally do not recognize &amp;ldquo;race&amp;rdquo; as biologically meaningful, but race is socially real, not biologically real.
Race as a social construct is contingent on social groups and their collective agreement and acceptance of the constructions.
Race is something that is real in society, and that shapes the way we see ourselves and others.</description>

      <description>Racism is not as simple as &amp;ldquo;hating all black people.&amp;rdquo;
It&amp;rsquo;s more accurate to say that racism is when one views one race as &amp;ldquo;innocent until proven guilty,&amp;rdquo; and another as &amp;ldquo;guilty until proven innocent.&amp;rdquo;
The fact that someone has black friends doesn&amp;rsquo;t say much, because it could be a case of &amp;ldquo;innocent until proven guilty,&amp;rdquo; but it could also be a case of &amp;ldquo;guilty until proven innocent.&amp;rdquo;
Whether or not someone has black friends doesn&amp;rsquo;t really say anything one way or another.</description>

      <description>You didn&amp;rsquo;t cross the Delaware river either.
You didn&amp;rsquo;t fight against the British in the Revolutionary War and you didn&amp;rsquo;t free the slaves, yet despite all that, we&amp;rsquo;d bet you&amp;rsquo;re proud to be an &amp;ldquo;American.&amp;rdquo;
If you&amp;rsquo;re going to take pride in your ancestors&amp;rsquo; accomplishments, it&amp;rsquo;s hypocritical to not take responsibility for their crimes.
Furthermore, you also directly benefit from the things your ancestors have done. In the same way that your grandparents being rich has an effect on your life, even if you don&amp;rsquo;t feel personally responsible, the racism of your ancestors has directly benefited you in ways you cannot deny or fathom without some reflection.</description>

      <description>And European settlers &amp;ldquo;belonged&amp;rdquo; in Europe by your logic. But guess what?
They colonized America, killed off a majority of the Indigenous population, enslaved our ancestors, designed systems that have us disproportionately enslaved today, and now their descendants think that the land has always been their own.
Oh, and if someone is born and raised in a particular region of the world, then they are from said region of the world.</description>

      <description>That&amp;rsquo;s good to hear. Now let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the institutions that oppress Black people and other people of color.
Structural racism is pervasive in U.S. policies, organizations, and across institutional domains, producing and sustaining racial inequality.
In the educational system, for example, minority students are graded differently and are disproportionately disciplined, and this causes many Black students to get left behind in said system, while their white counterparts move ahead.</description>

      <description>Before the recession, two-thirds of Americans surveyed said that the &amp;ldquo;American Dream&amp;rdquo; was harder to achieve. After the recession, even more Americans realized that not only was the &amp;ldquo;dream&amp;rdquo; unattainable, but that it was a myth.
In The Meritocracy Myth, sociologists McNamee and Miller posited that while merit on economic outcomes is vastly overestimated, non-merit factors can suppress or negate efforts. Joseph Eugene Stiglitz, an American economist, said that the U.</description>

      <description>If we&amp;rsquo;re not going to delve into the entire failure of Reconstruction to put Black people on anywhere near an equal footing in our society&amp;hellip;
The first thing we need to understand is the cost of credit, i.e., the interest rates on loans. Black people being systematically deprived from being lent to means that the community will have more difficulty building up wealth.
The most recent is by not being privy to Federal Housing Association (FHA) loans in the post World War II economic boom, Black people were prevented from accumulating capital in home ownership.</description>

      <description>By fearing (and thereby shunning) members of a minority group and discriminating against them in your day-to-day interactions, you help contribute to those very &amp;ldquo;statistics&amp;rdquo; that you loosely reference, which exist not because of some genetic predisposition to crime, but because certain groups face heavy, systemic discrimination.
The &amp;ldquo;statistics&amp;rdquo; only paint the picture you currently see when removed from the context in which they came into being, and if you were to actually examine the reasons for why those statistics are now skewed the way that they are, you would find that the only actual, reasonable solution here is to help end discrimination (the system of white supremacy) and as a result change those statistics for the better.</description>

      <description>Not all Black Americans are on welfare, so let&amp;rsquo;s try not to generalize here.
In fact, the greatest number of welfare recipients (by race) are white.
Let&amp;rsquo;s address this issue in relation to poor and working class Black Americans who are on welfare, though.
Giving financial support to the poor allows them to spend more of their income on the things they need. This is true even when cash is given with no strings attached, and no, poor folks do not spend whatever money is given to them on more drugs or alcohol, and studies indicate that if anything, financial support leads to less spending on drugs or alchohol.</description>

      <description>MLK would most likely be proud of BLM for spotlighting police brutality and putting discussions about systemic racism at the forefront of our national sociopolitical dialogue.
He probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a fan of their Liberal (or &amp;ldquo;moderate&amp;rdquo;) co-optation, or their glaring lack of economic policy and labor organizing strategies.

      <description>MLK was literally murdered for his politics. He was also critical of the capitalist system starting in his 20s, so he would not be a Republican today.
MLK did not belong to or identify with either major political party, and at times called out both parties for having failed and betrayed Black Americans. His father was a Republican prior to the Civil Rights Movement, as were many Black Americans, for this was during a time when the Republican Party was seen as the Party of Lincoln.</description>

      <description>Because white people make up a bigger part of the U.S. population; there are about three times as many white people in America than there are black people, so obviously they will be the majority of pretty much everything.
If you look at the rates and not just the numbers, though, black people get shot by police at a higher rate.
Black people make up 12 to 13 percent of the population but 31% of the police shooting victims.</description>

      <description>Constitution of the Confederate States:
Article 1, section 4 :
&amp;ldquo;No bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law denying or impairing the right of property in negro slaves shall be passed.&amp;rdquo;
Article 4, section 2:
&amp;ldquo;The citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States; and shall have the right of transit and sojourn in any State of this Confederacy, with their slaves and other property; and the right of property in said slaves shall not be thereby impaired.</description>

      <description>In an ideal, post-racial world, yes.
But we do not live in this ideal, post-racial world.
We must address the very real, systemic racism together in order to work through the divisions and bring everyone onto the same page of action.
Furthermore, it is worth keeping in mind that Black Americans are not responsible for &amp;ldquo;race.&amp;rdquo; It is &amp;ldquo;white&amp;rdquo; people (Europeans) who created and developed &amp;ldquo;race&amp;rdquo; as a social construct.</description>

      <description>Do you recommend we just live with potholes, or should we fix them?
Who defines the &amp;ldquo;other&amp;rdquo; and how do they define it? And why is it considered &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;fear&amp;rdquo; those who are different? Perhaps the solution is making it so that there is no fear between different people, and bringing people together both socially and economically.
People organize around &amp;ldquo;racial&amp;rdquo; lines in America because of the racialized institutions in our society, as well as their colonialist, white supremacist roots.</description>

Check out the 13th Amendment:
_Amendment XIII
Section 1.
Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.
Section 2.
Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation._

      <description>[This is not the flag of the Confederacy.
](https://goo.gl/images/MdCn2E)[This](https://goo.gl/images/CV9y7Z) was the first national flag, followed by &amp;ldquo;The Stainless Banner&amp;rdquo; (also know as The White Man&amp;rsquo;s Flag) and then finally &amp;ldquo;[.&amp;rdquo;
The flag people call the &amp;ldquo;Confederate flag&amp;rdquo; is actually the Battle Flag of the Army of Tennessee (a square version was used by General Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia). It was not popularized until it was flown in &amp;ldquo;historical films&amp;rdquo; such as The Birth of a Nation, which is what inspired the second Klu Klux Klan.</description>

      <description>It is true that the name of the slave-owning political party was the Democratic Party. After the Civil War, that party continued its exploitation of the former slaves through the Jim Crow system. The former slave owners made up the southern wing of the Democratic Party. Starting approximately after WWII, the more &amp;ldquo;liberal&amp;rdquo; parts of the Democratic Party began to push for social reform, including racial reform. The southern Democrats were absolutely opposed to any reform.</description>

      <description>Were the Irish ever slaves (period)?
Yes, in the sense that people in what is now the Republic of Ireland enslaved each other and were abducted for forced labor by other peoples.
Were the Irish ever slaves during the period the Atlantic slave trade provided labor to the United States of America and the colonies that became that country?
No.
&amp;ldquo;Slave&amp;rdquo; is a term with incredibly varied meaning depending on the locality and period.</description>

      <description>What is the source for this claim?
Black American people have been speaking out about racial issues for centuries now (our ancestors were brought here as enslaved Africans, so this won&amp;rsquo;t change anytime soon).
This isn&amp;rsquo;t even debatable.

      <description>Although the prevalence of single parenthood is definitely an issue, it is not thee problem.
Thee problem is and always has been colonialism, capitalism, imperialism, and white supremacy (amongst many other things).
We have to ask ourselves why this particular issue that is mentioned is indeed so common, and analyze the issue through a more structuralist framework.
Black Americans are more negatively impacted by our racist criminal justice system and are therefore more likely to go to jail than if they were white.</description>

      <description>Black people (in the racial sense) aren&amp;rsquo;t inherently less intelligent than other races, and to posit otherwise would be entirely unscientific, because there is no scientific basis for such a claim. Black people, just like all other people, are shaped largely by their environments.
Now if you&amp;rsquo;d like to discuss the environments Black people have been shaped by, that&amp;rsquo;s another (much longer) discussion.
You could start with the fact that our ancestors came to the U.</description>

      <description>Not only is there not any real unitary &amp;ldquo;white&amp;rdquo; history, but there is something to be said here about the utility of history (as a subject in schools, for example).
There is a common assumption that only the history of one&amp;rsquo;s own culture should be taught, perhaps with a little international &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo; stacked on top that either does not take into account what can be learned from the history of other cultures, or simply assumes one&amp;rsquo;s own culture is the most important.</description>

Welfare programs are a response to a problem, and our problem runs much deeper than what welfare programs alone can address.
We would argue that the reasons and circumstances that lead families to needing &amp;ldquo;welfare assistance&amp;rdquo; to begin with are the core problem (white supremacy and Capitalism are the two major &amp;ldquo;reasons&amp;rdquo;).</description>

      <description>This is a good opportunity to talk about the way that your position in life shapes the way you see things.
You don&amp;rsquo;t notice the ways that you benefit from being white because society has been (by and large) designed by people like you with you in mind. Bad things are less likely to happen to you because you are white – that isn&amp;rsquo;t to say that bad things couldn&amp;rsquo;t happen to you in spite of you being white, of course.</description>

      <description>Ahhh, the great myth of &amp;ldquo;Black-on-Black crime&amp;rdquo; is still with us.
This one was conjured up through a twisting of statistics around concentrated poverty paired with residential segregation.
The Atlanta Black Star cites a 2014 FBI report that shows us white Americans not only kill each other more frequently than any other racial group in America, but that there is only an eight percentage point margin between the rate at which Black Americans kill Black Americans, and the rate at which white people kill white people (in 2014, a Black American was killed by a member of the same race 90 percent of the time while a white person was killed by a member of the same race 82 percent of the time).</description>

      <description>Yet despite an increase in enrollment, Black Americans are still lagging behind in college population.
Many of the factors that contribute to one being able to attend college are inherited, meaning your family&amp;rsquo;s economic status is a strong indicator of whether you can attend college or not.
The wealth gap is extremely wide between white and Black, taken as an average or a median. A median white family has 10x the wealth of a median Black family.</description>

      <description>Assuming this is a Liberal talking point directed toward white Leftists, maybe we should clarify some things&amp;hellip;
Socialists are supposed to fight against ALL kinds of oppression, and this means oppression along the lines of race, gender, and more.
Many amongst the white working class are struggling to get jobs, as well as a living wage and general financial security.
That same oppression is not only replicated on other races and genders, but we (as Black Americans, for example) also have our own particular struggles with racism (and others are dealing with even more struggles on top of this, like misogyny or transphobia, for example).</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;White&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t a nationality, let alone an ethnic category - it is an extremely broad grouping based strictly upon skin color and other physical features, and a grouping so broad that one is basically saying that they are proud to not be an ethnic minority in saying that they are &amp;ldquo;proud to be white.&amp;rdquo;
There is no culture of &amp;ldquo;whiteness.&amp;rdquo;

This question implies that all Black people are poor.
Although there is a clear and major wealth gap, we as Black Americans have a class system too, for the record (and have had one for quite some time).
We can respond to this question two reasonable ways:
  Why do you think poor people just want &amp;ldquo;handouts&amp;rdquo; (as you call them)?
  Why are Black people disproportionately poor?</description>

      <description>Because the color of your skin predicts many of the outcomes you will experience in your life.
Where racists will point to these facts and, incorrectly, claim these are essential and immutable qualities of the races, Socialists understand that these material conditions are caused by institutions of power, both formal and informal, that exist to support some over others (principally, the ruling class over the working class).
Because race can be used as a wedge to divide us, society is structured to benefit some people over others.</description>

      <description>Black fatherlessness and gun violence are things that are absolutely talked about within America, but the biggest problem here is with regard to the diagnosis of why these issues are so prevalent and what the solutions are to fix them.
The attack on the &amp;ldquo;Black family&amp;rdquo; and the scourge of gun violence can be traced to some clear material causes:
  The drug wars that disproportionately target Black communities.</description>

      <description>Certainly you aren&amp;rsquo;t trying to imply that there is something inherent about black people that makes them predisposed to failure.
You just answered your own question.
Under a capitalist system, the incentive for any nation-state (and most private interests) isn&amp;rsquo;t to &amp;ldquo;help&amp;rdquo; African nations become &amp;ldquo;developed&amp;rdquo; for the benefit of Africans, but rather for the benefit of corporations (and more broadly, the global capitalist class) so that they may be in a better position to exploit the resources that Africa has to offer.</description>

      <description>We can not just advocate for ending Capitalist oppression, but we can also put specific ways in which the Black community is oppressed in the spotlight, while advocating for equality.
Not having that additional input from a marginalized community might end up perpetuating oppression from society, even if the socialist revolution succeeds.
This might be independent from actual policy. Maybe a Socialist leader is not antisemitic or racist, but without educating the people, any socialist policy&amp;rsquo;s effect will be dampened.</description>

      <description>Technically, it is correct that anyone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t defend marginalized people who look physically different than them, even when choosing to be neutral, is a racist in some way.
The foundation of Western society is based upon the construction of whiteness, which led to white supremacy. Those who are not being oppressed by the system of whiteness are usually those who uphold this system, and deny that systemic racism exists. These people who consciously or unconsciously defend whiteness could be anyone from average working-class folks, to Liberals, to &amp;ldquo;Brocialists,&amp;rdquo; to all-out reactionaries.</description>
