      <description>While he wrote a paper supporting eugenics in his school years, he quickliy renounced the idea after seeing it implemented in Germany.
Once premier, he rejected pressure to implement an eugenics program despite other provinces doing so and instead created programs to help those he once called subnormal.
Source (the Medical Post (PDF)):
Today we read his thesis through the lens of history, after the Naziâ€™s genocidal policies forever warped eugenics into a grotesque social experiment.</description>

      <description>Facts don&amp;rsquo;t care about anything, but that does not stop them from being taken out of context, misconstrued, and used to various political ends, correct? Statistics and facts are useless without proper interpretation and analysis.

      <description>Men have plenty to benefit from feminism.
Under patriarchy, men are expected to play their associated gender roles as well, and can be written off or alienated if they fail to do so.
Men who are in touch with their emotions, have a developed sense of empathy, who do not desire to enforce their will and dominate others, etc. are often mocked as &amp;ldquo;girly,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;gay,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;weak.&amp;rdquo;
In addition to all of the ways that feminism will liberate women, it will liberate men as well.</description>
