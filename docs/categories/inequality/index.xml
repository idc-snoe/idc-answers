      <description>Hmmm&amp;hellip; interesting.
In our view, straight (cishet) white men have been getting special treatment, instead of being equals to the rest of society.
Virtually any other demographic that is not white, cisgender, or male, has been on a disproportionate struggle of their own, no? It would be hard to argue that this has not been the case.
So what does that make our demands exactly? Furthermore, maybe you&amp;rsquo;re not exactly informed on what our demands are as Black American Socialists.</description>
