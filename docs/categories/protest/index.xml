      <description>The national anthem literally has racist lyrics.
The troops (of all types of ethnicities) fight imperialist wars for oligarchs that don&amp;rsquo;t care about them.
The U.S. government has lied to its citizens to start the last six major wars on false pretenses.
The U.S. flag is not a symbol of hope, but of hate, to much of the world.
If this statement is really about folks like Colin Kaepernick&amp;hellip;
Kaepernick originally sat during the national anthem but started kneeling out of respect to the troops after reaching out to veterans.</description>
