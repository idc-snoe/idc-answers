      <description>This ignores some&amp;hellip; let&amp;rsquo;s say &amp;ldquo;questionable&amp;rdquo; policies by certain &amp;ldquo;socialist&amp;rdquo; governments in the past, like the relocation of the Tatars in the USSR, for example.
It also ignores Third Positionism as a potential &amp;ldquo;socialist&amp;rdquo; position that addresses one thing, but not the other.
So while nationalism and race can be understood as a construct used by the bourgeoisie to divide and control the proletariat, it historically has not been that simple.</description>

      <description>Did systemic racism as we understand it today exist prior to Capitalism (mercantile or otherwise)?
Racial categories were originally created to define an economic class: slaves.
In addition, they served as an ideological tool to prevent poor whites from allying with Black people who actually share their class interests.
Gender has also been used in order to regulate social roles.
These aren&amp;rsquo;t separate systems of oppression that &amp;ldquo;occasionally&amp;rdquo; intersect; they are fundamentally interconnected.</description>
