      <description>Ignoring the problematic media portrayal of gulags, [capitalist countries had mastered concentration camps long before soviet gulags[(https://jacobinmag.com/2017/05/uk-concentration-camps-wwii-poland-internment-prisoners).
Over 20,000 children died of starvation and diseash in British concentration camps during the second Boer War (1899-1902) alone and thousands more suffered in compounds like the Lancaster Concentration Camp which saw Germain civilians be attacked with a bayonet charge to restore order.
Even today, for-profit prison systems in capitalist countries effectively enslave large portions of the population while exploiting their labor for as little as 23 cents an hour while producing items like produce for Walmart, uniforms for McDonald&amp;rsquo;s, and missiles for Lockheed Martin.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Morality&amp;rdquo; is perceived differently all over the world, and has changed throughout history. But not in any specific direction.
&amp;ldquo;Morality&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t easily quantifiable over time, as the moral axioms have changed. What is perceived by us as immoral today, was considered perfectly fine by people a century ago.
The definition of &amp;ldquo;justice&amp;rdquo; keeps changing, and so the &amp;ldquo;moral arc&amp;rdquo; tends to bend to justify ruling class domination.

      <description>The &amp;ldquo;establishment&amp;rdquo; is unabashedly guilty and even hypocritical, so why would we trust it on anything, let alone &amp;ldquo;self-regulation&amp;rdquo;? Most poor and working-class folks don&amp;rsquo;t like this setup (Capitalism); we&amp;rsquo;re just the ones explaining why this is, and how we can actually dismantle the setup (Capitalism) entirely.
