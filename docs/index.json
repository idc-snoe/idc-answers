	"content": "\u0026ldquo;All lives matter\u0026rdquo; is a clever trick.\nImagine getting shot in the leg and saying that you don\u0026rsquo;t want to lose your leg, and someone who is not wounded walking up and saying, \u0026ldquo;No one wants to lose their arm either.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No one wants to lose their arm\u0026rdquo; is a pretty reasonable position if you don\u0026rsquo;t consider anything else.\nBut if you consider the circumstances and the context, it is actually a nonsense thing to state.\nIf someone walked into a seminar being held by breast cancer researchers and started yelling that \u0026ldquo;all cancer matters,\u0026rdquo; and that \u0026ldquo;breast cancer researchers should be studying colon cancer instead,\u0026rdquo; they\u0026rsquo;d be laughed out of the room because 1) of course all cancer matters, but 2) the only reason other kinds of cancer would be played off each other like that is to derail the conversation.\nIf your house was burning down and you asked someone to call the fire department, imagine if they told you that \u0026ldquo;all houses matter.\u0026rdquo;\nShould they tell the fire department to attend to every house (even the ones not currently on fire)?\nThis is \u0026ldquo;all lives matter\u0026rdquo; in a nutshell.\nIt makes the preposterous claim that everyone has started out equally and thus everyone should be attended to equally, when that is demonstrably false.\nFurthermore, it feigns the victimhood of white people by implying that white lives are being ignored (poor and working-class white Americans have, up until now, collectively chosen to take the psychological wage that comes under white supremacy and Capitalism instead of working with poor and working-class Black Americans to dismantle these systems and build a better world).\nThe Black Lives Matter movement, even with all of its flaws, has not argued that Black lives matter more, but rather that Black lives matter JUST AS MUCH; there is an implicit \u0026ldquo;too\u0026rdquo; that goes along with \u0026ldquo;Black Lives Matter\u0026rdquo; (Black Lives Matter Too).\n"

	"content": "Policing was anti-Black long before rap music was invented.\nThe roots of modern policing exist not in town watches, as is often claimed, but in slave patrols.\nTown watches were always members of the community they patrolled with little-to-no special authority; they simply shared the responsibility of their community\u0026rsquo;s safety as part of living in that community.\nSlave patrollers, meanwhile, were usually either paid a wage or more often a bounty for returned slaves, and had additional legal authorities beyond a normal citizen. When the Compromise of 1850 forced Fugitive Slave Laws on free states, slave patrollers gained even freedom to operate, as these laws not only criminalized aiding slaves, but also allowed them to kidnap and enslave any Black person anywhere in the country with only a signed affidavit from the alleged owner.\nAbolition did not significantly slow police abuse of people of color.\nDuring Reconstruction, the need for non-farm labor that had previously been met by slaves was instead met by convict labor, almost exclusively recently freed Black people arrested for violating the new \u0026ldquo;Black Codes.\u0026rdquo;\nThe penal labor exemption of the Thirteenth Amendment allowed a system where forced labor of people of colors could be continued almost uninterrupted after emancipation (this is why we say slavery technically never ended). This system has lived on into the present day, and the rise of for-profit prisons, with contracts that often stipulate a minimum number of filled beds, has arguably escalated the exploitation of the most legally vulnerable members of communities: Black and brown Americans.\n"

	"content": "Policing institutions have their roots in slave patrols, so just keep that in mind when you tell Black people that they \u0026ldquo;have to listen to cops.\u0026rdquo;\nCops may have a difficult job, but what seems more relevant is how dangerous it is (or isn\u0026rsquo;t).\nPolicing is not actually as dangerous in terms of fatalities per worker as numerous other jobs, including construction, logging, fishing, and agriculture. A lot of the cop fatalities we hear about are just car accidents and have nothing to do with intentional harm. Now, maybe certain kinds of cops skew those statistics in one direction or another, so let\u0026rsquo;s grant for the sake of argument that some cops are routinely in extraordinary danger from potentially armed assailants.\nEven if that were the case, that still shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be license to murder someone for, say, pulling their pants up contrary to instructions.\nIf YOU (someone who isn\u0026rsquo;t a cop) shot someone simply for \u0026ldquo;not following directions\u0026rdquo;, there is a very large chance that you would be convicted of murder or manslaughter, as that is obviously insufficient justification for using lethal force.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also not illegal to carry a firearm, and it certainly is not illegal to be suspected of possibly having a weapon. Cops are clearly capable of refraining from shooting people who they KNOW have a gun (consider how many mass shooters are arrested rather than killed). The mass shooters who are arrested mostly happen to be white, too, which doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem like a coincidence.\nOr consider the Bundy standoff: a confrontation between around twenty armed ranchers and the bureau of land management that lasted several weeks and in which the ranchers had pointed weapons directly at the police; not even one single death resulted. These were people who the police KNEW were armed and could shoot them with a simple pull of the trigger and yet still, they didn\u0026rsquo;t shoot them.\nHow often have you been stopped by a cop with a drawn weapon barking instructions at you? Has it even happened once? For people in some communities, this is a frequent occurrence. Do you really think a life should end because on the fiftieth time someone was harassed by a cop, they didn\u0026rsquo;t put their hands in the right place fast enough?\nShooting someone for not following directions is putting a cop\u0026rsquo;s convenience above the life of those they are supposedly sworn to \u0026ldquo;serve\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;protect\u0026rdquo; (we know this is not actually the role of the police historically). Now, sure, a standoff is a high pressure situation for a cop. And if it\u0026rsquo;s a high pressure situation for a cop, it\u0026rsquo;s that much higher for the one who has a gun pointed at them, especially considering how trigger-happy cops seem to be. Too often cops will unnecessarily escalate situations into such standoffs.\nPutting aside whether or not there should even be cops in the first place (there shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be cops, by the way), maybe people who aren\u0026rsquo;t really prepared to put their own life on the line, and who shoot people who aren\u0026rsquo;t obviously a threat on the pretext that they are \u0026ldquo;afraid for their lif,\u0026rdquo; shouldn\u0026rsquo;t actually be cops. And maybe they should figure this out before they KILL SOMEONE. And maybe those who are dismissed because they killed someone in such a fashion shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be hired to do police work in the next county over.\nYou can argue that cops sometimes have a reason to use lethal force. But we constantly see cases where they use it without having sufficient justification and someone ends up dead. And it disproportionately happens to Black people because they are disproportionately targeted for various reasons, including where they live, implicit bias, spurious 911 calls, and simple, intentional profiling.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easy to say that you have to follow a cop\u0026rsquo;s directions if you\u0026rsquo;re not regularly on the receiving end of such directions. If you are, have you always managed to perfectly comply, and can you really expect that of someone every time? What if the directions aren\u0026rsquo;t even consistent, as has certainly happened before? If you\u0026rsquo;re not regularly on the receiving end of such directions, maybe consider how your opinion might change if you were, because there are people for whom that is reality, and their lives matter just as much as yours.\n"

Douglas himself recognized this change long before most others did. When he visited Germany in 1936 as an ambassador for the World Youth Congress, he attended one of Adolf Hitler’s rallies. There he experienced a “frightful” epiphany that led him to reject his earlier beliefs.\nWhen he took public office as the premier of Saskatchewan in 1944, he resisted pressures to implement a eugenics program. While the premiers in B.C. and Alberta and the governors of 24 U.S. states passed laws mandating sterilization, Douglas brought in programs to provide therapies and vocational training for the people he once labelled “subnormal.”\n"

Many bot user names contain numbers, which can indicate automatic name generation. The account primarily retweets content, rather than tweeting original content. The account’s tweet frequency is higher than a human user could feasibly achieve. The account may have a high number of followers and also be following a lot of accounts; conversely, some bot accounts are identifiable because they send a lot of tweets but only have a few followers. More in this link  In addition to bots, watch out for bad faith actors who are frequently employees or volunteers with organizations that intentionally create division and arguments to waste your time and prevent communities from uniting.\nA Field Guide to Bad Faith Arguments\n Do not offer sources or what sources would convince them. See: Flat-earthers. Creates strawman arguments, assuming your position and arguing against that - not what you\u0026rsquo;re actually saying. Acts as a lie detector, accuses you of lying when contradicted Acts as a fake free speech advocate. They confuse disagreement with silencing, delegitimization, and censorship. See: Jordan Peterson on Transgender pronouns Purity testers don\u0026rsquo;t tell you a policy agenda is wrong; they’re here to tell you those are bad spokespeople for their cause.

	"content": "You are one step away from understanding the underlying cause of oppression, Capitalism.\nThe underlying assumption of a race-only solution is that when racial groups are forced together (through law and regulation), they will work out their differences, i.e. the \u0026ldquo;melting pot.\u0026rdquo; The antebellum South in the U.S. or apartheid South Africa are examples of intense, daily contact and deep familiarity between dominant and dominated individuals, where contact didn\u0026rsquo;t diminish prejudice. Increased intergroup contact only works if the persons concerned are equal in status, have common goals, are not in competition, and if the contact is sanctioned by authority (Pettigrew, T. F., \u0026amp; Tropp, L. R. (2006). A meta-analytic test of intergroup contact theory. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 90(5), 751-783.).\nAlso, the outgroup suffers significant adverse effects during this process. Among many other issues, minorities and immigrants throughout the world suffer from worse health than host or majority populations and this problem has been observed in virtually all modern industrial societies. Part of this disparity is economic, but stress has been recognized as the crucial causal link between discrimination and health. The psychological and physical negative effects on the outgroup are significant. An exception to this rule is the \u0026ldquo;ethnic density\u0026rdquo; effect in which minorities and immigrants who live among members of their group are healthier than those who live among the majority population. Scientists have suggested that due to density, individuals have more and better social ties in homogeneous places and/or that ethnic density provides \u0026ldquo;buffering\u0026rdquo; against the social-psychological effects of discrimination (Boyer P., Firat R., van Leeuwen F., Perspectives in Psychological Science, 2015).\nEmployment and education quotas alone as an attempt to increase contact with outgroups to solve racial issues is impractical and immoral. The cost of assimilation to the culture, identity, psychology, and health of the outgroup is significant. Under Capitalism, education and employment are competitive and stratified while diminishing prejudice only happens with equal status and no competition.\nThe goals of Capitalism and equality are incompatible. Race can only be addressed if \u0026ldquo;economic stuff\u0026rdquo; is addressed.\n"

This means they have control of most of our major industries and institutions (this includes the government and greater state apparatus as well), and so the mechanisms that maintain and push white supremacy (control) throughout our greater society are extremely pervasive all throughout the country.\n"

Black people being systematically deprived from being lent to means that the community will have more difficulty building up wealth.\nThe most recent is by not being privy to Federal Housing Association (FHA) loans in the post World War II economic boom, Black people were prevented from accumulating capital in home ownership. This has a cumulative effect on Black wealth; if I give you a dollar to invest that accumulates value over time, and I don\u0026rsquo;t lend another person that same dollar, when I come calling for that dollar in the future, you will still have more money than the other person. Now spread this out by many thousands of times (and over decades), and you can understand why white net worth is nearly 10 times Black net worth in the U.S.\nBlack communities being segregated and devalued by realtors meant that a Black-owned house was worth less, even if Black homeowners could get loans to build wealth.\nThis is discussed by the scholar Mehrsa Baradaran in The Color of Money.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s worth looking at the history of Black-owned banks in the United States as well.\nLook at the Freedman\u0026rsquo;s Bank, where Black people were accumulating deposits of capital that were wiped out by railroad speculation (done by white speculators who were managing this capital, not Black speculators!) and then not backed by the federal government. This collapse was wildly damaging to the trust the Black community had in banking in general for decades, further preventing Black citizens from building wealth, as they did not have access to credit that other groups could take advantage of (especially other immigrant groups that are highlighted by Baradaran\u0026rsquo;s research in the 1900s in this Intercepted podcast interview).\n"

Regardless of where they started, the gaps between immigrants and natives persisted throughout their lives. However, among the discrepancies of second generation citizens, children with less-foreign-sounding names who completed more years of schooling earned more, and were less likely to be unemployed as compared to their counterparts whose names sounded more foreign.\nIt is likely that their foreign-sounding names exposed them to discrimination at school or on the job (see here). It hasn\u0026rsquo;t been a lack of English language proficiency or assimilation that stalled upward mobility; the issue is that immigrants have been confronted with ethnocentrism and a socioeconomic system (Capitalism) in which upward mobility is a myth.\nContrary to popular belief, America doesn\u0026rsquo;t have an official language. America also has more native Spanish speakers than Spain itself. Not to mention most countries in the EU, Asia, and even Africa speak more than one language. Among the \u0026ldquo;developed\u0026rdquo; world, we are one of the only ones who speak only one language primarily. If anything, we should all be learning to use Spanish too, or French, and require it for the workplace as well as through high school.\nStudies show that bilingual children are better at problem-solving and creative tasks on average. America only stands to gain more by becoming multilingual.\nNot to mention there are plenty of dialects of other languages that are only spoken here! For example, Texan German is a thing because of migrants passing it down through generations. Louisiana French is another example of a language only spoken here. And at some point, it will be the same way for Spanish. That\u0026rsquo;s not even counting AAVE (Black American English in all of its forms).\nWe should embrace language diversity.\n"

His father was a Republican prior to the Civil Rights Movement, as were many Black Americans, for this was during a time when the Republican Party was seen as the Party of Lincoln.\nPolitical parties have changed their values significantly over the course of American history, to the point that the current Republican Party bares little resemblance to the Republican Party during the time of Lincoln.\n"

In all such territory the institution of negro slavery, as it now exists in the Confederate States, shall be recognized and protected be Congress and by the Territorial government; and the inhabitants of the several Confederate States and Territories shall have the right to take to such Territory any slaves lawfully held by them in any of the States or Territories of the Confederate States.\u0026rdquo;\nA key component of the racist ideology of the Confederacy was that the enslavement and general oppression of Black people were necessary for the freedom of white people, including white people who did not own slaves. Even the poorest white person was better off than an enslaved Black person (or any Black person) in material terms. So non-slave-owning white people did have a real material interest of the subordination of Black people. This was compounded by the fact that a key myth of pro-slavery ideology was that slavery was necessary for white people to keep what they had, no matter how little that was.\nAdditionally, it is perfectly possible to support something even if you don\u0026rsquo;t participate in it. For instance, some believe that cannabis should be legal even though they don\u0026rsquo;t use it. Similarly, the non-slave-owning ancestors of the person(s) asking this question could easily have supported slavery without actually owning anyone as an enslaved person.\nFinally, to quote Alexander Stephens, vice president of the Confederacy:\n\u0026ldquo;the new Constitution has put at rest forever all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institutions-African slavery as it exists among us-the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution.\n[…]\nOur new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and moral condition.\u0026rdquo;\nWhy one would argue that supporting the Confederacy was not \u0026ldquo;necessarily\u0026rdquo; about slavery when the Confederacy\u0026rsquo;s leaders say the exact opposite is beyond us (but not really).\n"

Policing as an institution in America was started to catch runaway slaves, and to this day the racist trend continues (neo-Nazis have been infiltrating police ranks for decades now). All police are serving an institution that is predicated on economic and racial injustice since the laws of the land themselves do so.\nA Nixon official was quoted as saying the reason Nixon stated the war on drugs was to target hippies and Blacks, and that\u0026rsquo;s but one example.\n"

	"content": "Most people agree that compromise is essential in electoral politics and \u0026ldquo;politics\u0026rdquo; in general. The failure of politicians to compromise is often attributed to political polarization of our country – that is, for the Right and the Left to come to the middle. However, Gutmann and Thompson argue that there is an internal tension in political compromise in that the democratic process requires politicians both to resist compromise and to embrace it. Specifically, they point to the uncompromising mindset that characterizes campaigning which obstructs the search for desirable compromises:\n\u0026ldquo;It is like an invasive species that spreads beyond its natural habitat as it roams from the campaign to the government.\u0026quot;\nUnfortunately, a lack of compromise favors the status quo. Media have pushed surveys faulting the Republicans for the lack of compromise mindset. In accordance with this, when looking at issues like the minimum wage, Liberals, whose position is typically to raise the wage, are more likely to compromise than Republicans. But the opposite is true on issues like tax reform, where Democrats are defending the status quo. As a result, the citizens are stuck with the status quo.\nObviously, not much can change without some compromise, and major change needs major compromises. The solutions offered by the capitalist establishment, or at least the media as stenographers for the establishment, is \u0026ldquo;We get there only if constituents give legislators the freedom to compromise.\u0026quot;\nDavid Davenport in Forbes wrote: I, for one, plan to stop voting for candidates who are more committed to their reelection, their party, and their one-word litmus tests than they are to making the government work.\u0026quot;\nAs usual, the attitude of the capitalist class isn\u0026rsquo;t to change the two-party electoral system, adopt a different voting style, or some other governmental feature to make compromise and therefore change possible. Instead, their solution is to blame constituents for lack of compromise and politicians maintaining the status quo.\n"

Institutions such as the media, police, schools, work, etc. all contribute to our positive and negative explicit and implicit (unconscious) biases.\nThe media broadcasts stories and images of urban violence, racial discord, and police violence, giving us unconscious associations between blackness and poverty + neighborhood disinvestment. The media also promotes solutions such as \u0026ldquo;War on Crime,\u0026rdquo; which in turn contribute to more systemic racism and help push laws and policies that limit our freedoms.\nThe media significantly informs social implicit biases. While some police are explicitly racist, everyone, including the police, teachers, doctors, etc. have implicit (unconscious) biases that affect their understandings and decisions. Explicit and implicit social biases lead to more people calling the police on Black Americans, the police targeting Black Americans for routine traffic stops, more police using disproportionate amount of force (much of which is deadly), and more.\nThe media then publicizes these events, further reinforcing our assumptions. While those who do harm to others and corrupt police officers must be held accountable (we see the police force as a tool of the state and the Capitalist class and therefore believe it should be dismantled so that we can have community control/policing), we also need to recognize that structural racism exists as a function of Capitalism.\n"

Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia). It was not popularized until it was flown in \u0026ldquo;historical films\u0026rdquo; such as The Birth of a Nation, which is what inspired the second Klu Klux Klan. It was also flown in Gone with the Wind, amongst other films, and then later associated with \u0026ldquo;Southern Pride\u0026rdquo; when Dixiecrats started using it to oppose the Civil Rights Movement during the 1960s. It was integrated into Georgia\u0026rsquo;s state flag in 1956 as a reaction to Brown v. Board of Education and was raised by University of Mississippi during protests against integrating schools (a way of saying you are legally allowed to attend, but you are not welcome).\nSouthern heritage, pride, and race are interlinked, therefore the support for the Confederate flag is not just about racial attitudes or southern heritage alone and/or separately, but both.\nThe flag has been used for discriminatory purposes. It represents more than the Civil War and its official endorsement of slavery. It also stands for a history of vocal resistance to racial and political equality for Blacks and other minorities.\nThe intensity of the political fight over the Confederate flag has actually led some researchers to investigate the \u0026ldquo;heritage\u0026rdquo; versus \u0026ldquo;hate\u0026rdquo; debate.\nResearchers found that a widespread defense of the Confederate flag among whites has much more to do with racial concerns than with other aspects of southern heritage.

Wike. \u0026ldquo;Confederate Symbols, Southern Identity, and Racial Attitudes: The Case of the Georgia State Flag.\u0026rdquo; Social Science Quarterly, vol. 79, no. 3, 1998, pp. 568–580.).\nThe Confederate flag has been used by the KKK and other white supremacists who oppose racial justice up until today. Even government official George Wallace\u0026rsquo;s 1963 \u0026ldquo;Segregation Forever\u0026rdquo; campaign included raising the Confederate flag. The symbolism and function of the Confederate flag therefore is not merely a neutral cultural object, but a ritual object of power, dominance, and subordination (Shanafelt, R. (2008)).

	"content": "It is true that the name of the slave-owning political party was the Democratic Party. After the Civil War, that party continued its exploitation of the former slaves through the Jim Crow system. The former slave owners made up the southern wing of the Democratic Party. Starting approximately after WWII, the more \u0026ldquo;liberal\u0026rdquo; parts of the Democratic Party began to push for social reform, including racial reform. The southern Democrats were absolutely opposed to any reform. As early as 1948, some Democrats began to split off. Strom Thurmond, for example, left the party and became a \u0026ldquo;Dixiecrat.\u0026rdquo;\nThe racial reform picked up steam with Brown v. Board of Education. Eisenhower sent in federal troops to integrate schools in Arkansas. Then Kennedy pushed for civil rights reform. The real disaster for the southern Democrats happened when Johnson got the 1964 Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act passed. In 1968, the Republicans realized they could take the entire southern Democratic vote by using the \u0026ldquo;Southern Strategy.\u0026rdquo; They began using racist dog whistles and other political strategies to appeal to southern whites. The national Republican Party then became the new \u0026ldquo;Jim Crow\u0026rdquo; Democratic Party.\nThe southern strategy worked spectacularly well. \u0026ldquo;Democrat\u0026rdquo; became a slur word. The name \u0026ldquo;Democratic Party\u0026rdquo; remained the same; the former southern Jim Crow Democrats changed their name to \u0026ldquo;Republican.\u0026rdquo; Only the name changed; the political beliefs remained the same.\nThe progressive, Liberal Republicans of 1860 ended slavery. The old conservative, reactionary, and racist Democrats of 1860 wanted to keep slavery.\nNow we could be super petty and bring up how the Republican Party back then was filled to the brim with Socialists, Communists, and Anarchists\u0026hellip; you know, mention folks like August Willich (who even challenged Marx to a gun duel because he thought Marx was too conservative), Joseph Weydemeyer, and others. We could even talk about how Marx wrote letters in support of Lincoln\u0026rsquo;s fight against slavery.\nWould the modern day Republicans support such \u0026ldquo;radicals\u0026rdquo;? If they do not, then it is clear that they do not support the \u0026ldquo;radical\u0026rdquo; ideals that the Republican Party was, at one point, representative of, and thus have little right to claim Lincoln for themselves.\nThe short response to this statement is really that we are so far removed from the traditional identities of the two major parties that this talking point is moot.\n"

	"content": "Were the Irish ever slaves (period)?\nYes, in the sense that people in what is now the Republic of Ireland enslaved each other and were abducted for forced labor by other peoples.\nWere the Irish ever slaves during the period the Atlantic slave trade provided labor to the United States of America and the colonies that became that country?\nNo.\n\u0026ldquo;Slave\u0026rdquo; is a term with incredibly varied meaning depending on the locality and period. Conveniently, colonial and early U.S. documents leave a body of law collectively called \u0026ldquo;Slave Codes\u0026rdquo; that as a whole give a fairly clear legal definition of slavery. A slave was any black person, or less often an \u0026ldquo;American Indian,\u0026rdquo; who was property by virtue of either legal sale, or who received the status of slave by being born to a slave. Persons were considered \u0026ldquo;black\u0026rdquo; if they had any provable African ancestry, and in most states only the children of female slaves were automatically slaves.\nThere was a significant population of Irish people who immigrated under indenture. This is legally distinct from the chattel slavery discussed above, though it is another form of forced labor. Indenture is a form of labor equity in which a person promises their labor for a specific period of time in exchange for something else of value, such as an education in a trade, or in this case transatlantic passage. The indentured person would not only be required to labor for the period of indenture, but also have their mobility and legal rights restricted by the person holding their indenture. They could not travel, marry, or make other legal contracts without the permission of the indenture holder. Someone who paid for passage across the Atlantic through indenture was undertaking a legal status similar to an apprentice in a contemporary guild, who promised their labor for a set period in return for education in a craft and eventual recognition as a journeyman.\nThe important distinction here is that while both indentured servitude and chattel slavery are forms of forced labor, a person under indenture was still legally a person. They had the same protections and rights under the law as any other person, other than those specifically superseded by the rights of the indenture holder. Any child they bore would be free, barring a choice to sell their indenture. A slave, meanwhile, is not considered (and treated as) a person. Their only legal presence is in a proof of purchase, similar to livestock. A slave could not marry any more than a plow horse could marry, and any children a slave might bear would also be slaves.\nWhen discussing the Irish there is one form of indenture that is especially notable: convict indenture.\nThe British government sent numerous political and non-political prisoners to their colonies in North America and especially the Caribbean. A significant number of these individuals would have been Irish. While these people had significantly less choice in the matter, legally they were still serving an indenture, rather than slaves.\nThey were legally still people and, after serving their specific period, they would be free.\nIndenture fell off drastically after the American Revolution. The nascent United States was not an attractive place for foreign business ventures, and so while immigration continued there was significantly less capital to invest, and less faith that the terms of indenture would be enforced. Slavery, meanwhile, was the backbone of much of the new country\u0026rsquo;s economy, and would continue well after the 1807 Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves.\nForced labor is forced labor, but it is dishonest to compare the exploitation of the Irish and other poor immigrants faced during the USA\u0026rsquo;s founding and early growth with the atrocities committed against Black and Indigenous/Native people during this same period.\nThe Irish in America were often mistreated, but they were always legally people.\nFor much of our history, Africans were not.\n"

You must support them based on the name alone, no?\nOkay, so here\u0026rsquo;s the serious response\u0026hellip;\nIt is important to understand what the political climate of Germany was like in the 1920s, and why Hitler might have thought it wise to use the term \u0026ldquo;Socialism\u0026rdquo; (it\u0026rsquo;s actually a trick that the fascists use a lot throughout history).\nSocialism was very popular in Germany before Hitler\u0026rsquo;s rise to power (the Spartacist Uprising shows this).\nHitler was not a fool; he used Socialism to get people on board.\nWhen Hitler came into power, things were getting bad economically. Hitler used this period as an opportunity to spread his form of \u0026ldquo;populism\u0026rdquo; (the fascists love fake populism). He even spoke in the language of the Left sometimes. He called himself a \u0026ldquo;National Socialist.\u0026rdquo; This alone is a red flag (and not the good kind).\nSocialism is international in nature.\nHowever, it\u0026rsquo;s not hard to see that actual Socialists were adamantly against Hitler at the time. The international Left in general was. It is no surprise that Hitler targeted the Left first when he came into power (Martin Niemöller\u0026rsquo;s First They Came poem is a contemporary account of this fact). Hitler wanted nothing to do with Socialism.\nIf this is not enough to convince you, there are various speeches and policy points you can look at that quite literally represent the antithesis of Socialism.\nSo who benefited from Hitler\u0026rsquo;s rise to power? Was it the people? Or Capitalists who received billions of dollars to build a war machine?\nHitler (who was Nazism personified for Nazis) was a fan of eugenics, social darwinism, and was hostile to both unionism and Communism. He went about privatizing as much as he could and gave Capitalism whatever it needed as long as it was serving the fascist state. That is not Socialism.\n\u0026ldquo;First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—\nBecause I was not a Socialist.\nThen they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—\nBecause I was not a trade unionist.\nThen they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—\nBecause I was not a Jew.\nThen they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.\u0026rdquo;\nWhen Socialism comes, we can tell you who it will benefit:\nThe people.\n"

Racism at large is just divisive, and to let the racists purify your \u0026ldquo;white\u0026rdquo; history so people with white skin seem \u0026ldquo;superior\u0026rdquo; just makes us forget the errors that \u0026ldquo;white\u0026rdquo; people have been a part of and continue to perpetuate.\n"

For instance, in education, giving students the same amounts of instruction, lessons, and identical learning materials is different than providing students with the necessary resources to reach educational goals and achieve academic success.\nIn a socialist society, people are not treated the same, but the productive power of society is harnessed to serve everyone\u0026rsquo;s needs.\nEquality is treating everyone with equal value, and assures fairness in that everyone ought to have equal opportunity and equal benefit from their knowledge and skills, thereby achieving equality in fair results.\nWe may not be able to reach true equality in opportunity, but the goal should be for us to get as close to this as possible as a human species.\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": "This is a good opportunity to talk about the way that your position in life shapes the way you see things.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t notice the ways that you benefit from being white because society has been (by and large) designed by people like you with you in mind. Bad things are less likely to happen to you because you are white – that isn\u0026rsquo;t to say that bad things couldn\u0026rsquo;t happen to you in spite of you being white, of course.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the difference between the experience of an ethnic minority in this country, and the experience of a person who identifies with the majority \u0026ldquo;white\u0026rdquo; culture. But people from other backgrounds have bad things happen to them and notice that it is because of them not being white. And they notice that because these things happen to them in addition to all of the bad things that happen to them for the same reasons that bad things happen to white people.\nWe see it, and we notice it, because it hits our bottom line.\nSo the ways that you\u0026rsquo;ve benefited from being white, in a society dominated by whiteness, is that bad things haven\u0026rsquo;t happened to you because of your race. In contrast, bad things happen to non-white people in this county because of their race.\nOne of the most stunning statistics we can mention here is the average net worth of whites vs. \u0026ldquo;Hispanics\u0026rdquo; and Black Americans.\nIt is stark.\nIn 2016, white families had the highest level of both median and mean family wealth: $171,000 and $933,700, respectively (figure 1). Black and Hispanic families have considerably less wealth than white families. Black families\u0026rsquo; median and mean net worth is less than 15 percent that of white families, at $17,600 and $138,200, respectively. Hispanic families\u0026rsquo; median and mean net worth was $20,700 and $191,200, respectively.\nYou are reading this right.\nMedian white family wealth is $171,000 vs. $17,600 for Blacks, and $20,700 for \u0026ldquo;Hispanics.\u0026rdquo;\nAlthough most families do have some wealth, the number with zero or negative net worth (having debts that exceed assets) is nontrivial and varies by race/ethnicity. Nearly one in five black households has zero or negative net worth. The share of white households without any wealth is considerably smaller, at 9 percent. Hispanic and other households fall somewhere in between white and black families on this measure.\nFor many families, the primary residence is an important component of the balance sheet. Well over half of white households are homeowners (73 percent), compared with just under half of black and Hispanic households (around 45 percent) and 54 percent of other households. Among homeowners, white households also hold considerably higher levels of equity in their homes. Mean net housing wealth (the value of the home, less any debts on the home) among homeowners is $215,800 among white families but only $94,400 among black families and $129,800 among Hispanic families. White homeowners hold more home equity, but housing accounts for only 32 percent of their total assets, compared with 37 to 39 percent for black and Hispanic homeowners.\nIn addition to substantial heterogeneity within race/ethnicity groups by education, there are also large disparities across race/ethnicity groups for families with similar levels of education. Among households headed by someone with a college degree, net worth is substantially higher for white families than for the other three groups of families. The median net worth of college graduates in 2016 was $397,100 for white families, but well below $100,000 for black families and Hispanic families.\nThis advantage is hard to see for most white people, and for various reasons (mostly because most white people spend most of their time around other white people of the same, or a similar, class, which isn\u0026rsquo;t something unique).\n"

A median white family has 10x the wealth of a median Black family.\nThis leads to the final point, as these differences exist even when controlling for other factors:\nEven if Black Americans make it to college, their wages are much lower than whites, and this has actually gotten worse since the 1970s.\n"

	"content": "Certainly you aren\u0026rsquo;t trying to imply that there is something inherent about black people that makes them predisposed to failure.\nYou just answered your own question.\nUnder a capitalist system, the incentive for any nation-state (and most private interests) isn\u0026rsquo;t to \u0026ldquo;help\u0026rdquo; African nations become \u0026ldquo;developed\u0026rdquo; for the benefit of Africans, but rather for the benefit of corporations (and more broadly, the global capitalist class) so that they may be in a better position to exploit the resources that Africa has to offer.\n\u0026ldquo;Aid\u0026rdquo; in a capitalist system is not used to help people primarily, but as a bargaining tool to enable or support resource and labor exploitation.\nDespite \u0026ldquo;aid\u0026rdquo; from western countries, the amount of money flowing out of Africa to the West still dwarfs the amount coming in. This is due to regressive trade laws that mean that poor countries are required to open their markets to foreign goods (dumping).\nSince the mid 20th century, many African leaders who attempted to end this and develop their countries in the same way that western countries had (tax and spend, build public industry and services, etc.) have been couped and assassinated, mostly with help from the French, United Kingdom, and United States. (Sankara, Lumumba, Nkrumah, etc.).\nYes there are corrupt people in those countries at the top, and this does not contradict the imperialism hypothesis, as they are required by the richer countries to make the money flow.\n"

	"content": "We can not just advocate for ending Capitalist oppression, but we can also put specific ways in which the Black community is oppressed in the spotlight, while advocating for equality.\nNot having that additional input from a marginalized community might end up perpetuating oppression from society, even if the socialist revolution succeeds.\nThis might be independent from actual policy. Maybe a Socialist leader is not antisemitic or racist, but without educating the people, any socialist policy\u0026rsquo;s effect will be dampened.\nBSA is not opposed or in contrast to white Socialists any more than it would be antithetical to a Black Socialists of Belgium, if such a group were to exist. The fact that \u0026ldquo;Black\u0026rdquo; in the title of our organization brings about discomfort, tension, and/or suspicion is why it is so important for this organization to exist, as it represents a community under an oppressive system of white supremacy, which is disproportionately impacted by Capitalism.\nAs such, we oppose Capitalism and white supremacy (not white people), while representing the socioeconomic interests of many Black American Leftists as a critical agent and voice in a cross-racial and multiethnic socialist movement.\n"

	"content": "Technically, it is correct that anyone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t defend marginalized people who look physically different than them, even when choosing to be neutral, is a racist in some way.\nThe foundation of Western society is based upon the construction of whiteness, which led to white supremacy. Those who are not being oppressed by the system of whiteness are usually those who uphold this system, and deny that systemic racism exists. These people who consciously or unconsciously defend whiteness could be anyone from average working-class folks, to Liberals, to \u0026ldquo;Brocialists,\u0026rdquo; to all-out reactionaries.\nTo deconstruct whiteness, the foremost step is to acknowledge its existence, and to recognize that marginalized people are being oppressed by the specter of whiteness and white supremacy.\nIt is crucial that all Leftists do this (otherwise, there is nothing to separate you from the racists).\nIt is also worth noting that what often ends up happening is that many confuse \u0026ldquo;racist\u0026rdquo; as an identity with \u0026ldquo;racist\u0026rdquo; as an adjective.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to be in the KKK to be racist, and you don\u0026rsquo;t have to love Hitler to do something fascist.\nIf something you said shows prejudice against a racial/ethnic group, or blankets them as a whole, it\u0026rsquo;s probably racist, even if you don\u0026rsquo;t think of yourself that way.\nThis same thing applies with fascism.\nIf you think all criminals should be put to death, that\u0026rsquo;s something a fascist might say and it\u0026rsquo;s a fascist thing to say, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you would join an American \u0026ldquo;Fascist Party.\u0026rdquo;\nIn general, a lot of people are extremely sensitive to criticism or the possibility of feeling misrepresented; we are are not different in that regard. We don\u0026rsquo;t like being told that we call everyone we don\u0026rsquo;t like racist; it just so happens that when people do racist things and we call them on it, they don\u0026rsquo;t like it.\nIf you genuinely don\u0026rsquo;t want to be considered a racist or fascist, then you should listen when someone calls something you did racist or fascist (at the minimum). We can, for the most part, tell when someone is being unreasonable, but you have to at least hear others out, especially if you want them to trust you, be your friend, and/or stay your friend.\n"

And the relationship between violence and revolution has been exaggerated.\nIn the past, the dominant narrative has linked violence with rebellion because of their own military response to those who oppose oppression. Further, shocked by the threat to the existing order, the violence associated with rebellion and revolution has been distorted and greatly exaggerated by the hostile establishment and chroniclers who were the main sources of historical documentation.\nRevolutions have also been historically romanticized as violent in art, literature, and film to symbolically represent revolutionaries as heroic leaders willing to take up arms and to give up their lives as a demonstration of their commitment to the cause. It is in the hands of the capitalist class not to treat revolutionaries as irrational and bloodthirsty mobs, but to listen to reason and recognize them as politically organized, ideologically consistent, socially sanctioned movements of unarmed resistance. The claim that unarmed resisters are causing violence is the dominant narrative attempting to constrain, maintain, and impose control over the voice of the anti-racist, anti-capitalist opposition.\n"
