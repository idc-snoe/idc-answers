      <description>&amp;ldquo;All lives matter&amp;rdquo; is a clever trick.
Imagine getting shot in the leg and saying that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to lose your leg, and someone who is not wounded walking up and saying, &amp;ldquo;No one wants to lose their arm either.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;No one wants to lose their arm&amp;rdquo; is a pretty reasonable position if you don&amp;rsquo;t consider anything else.
But if you consider the circumstances and the context, it is actually a nonsense thing to state.</description>

      <description>Ignoring the problematic media portrayal of gulags, [capitalist countries had mastered concentration camps long before soviet gulags[(https://jacobinmag.com/2017/05/uk-concentration-camps-wwii-poland-internment-prisoners).
Over 20,000 children died of starvation and diseash in British concentration camps during the second Boer War (1899-1902) alone and thousands more suffered in compounds like the Lancaster Concentration Camp which saw Germain civilians be attacked with a bayonet charge to restore order.
Even today, for-profit prison systems in capitalist countries effectively enslave large portions of the population while exploiting their labor for as little as 23 cents an hour while producing items like produce for Walmart, uniforms for McDonald&amp;rsquo;s, and missiles for Lockheed Martin.</description>

      <description>Eugene Debs wasn&amp;rsquo;t right about everything, but he was certainly right about a lot.
We&amp;rsquo;ll leave you with this quote from him that is a core part of our philosophy:
&amp;ldquo;While there is a lower class, I am in it.
While there is a criminal element, I am of it.
And while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>This all depends on what you mean when you say &amp;ldquo;racist.&amp;rdquo; Usually when someone says this, what they&amp;rsquo;re really trying to do is equate prejudices expressed or acted upon by Black Americans with the racism and prejudice of &amp;ldquo;white&amp;rdquo; Americans. This leaves out centuries of historical context, as well as the context of our present circumstances. Black Americans only make up 12.6% of the U.S. population and &amp;ldquo;white&amp;rdquo; Americans hold most of the institutional power, so it&amp;rsquo;s worth thinking about the big picture here.</description>

      <description>What you&amp;rsquo;re trying to imply here is that Black Americans are genetically predisposed to be more violent, which is kind of ironic given Black Americans are on U.S. soil today because we were violently extracted from Africa and violently enslaved for centuries, primarily by &amp;ldquo;white&amp;rdquo; people (Europeans). This is race science hogwash.</description>

      <description>Telling someone to be grateful for their own abduction is absurd, especially when there are so many obvious problems now (colonialism&amp;rsquo;s effects in modern day Africa would still affect Blacks if they were &amp;ldquo;left&amp;rdquo;).</description>

      <description>Policing was anti-Black long before rap music was invented.
The roots of modern policing exist not in town watches, as is often claimed, but in slave patrols.
Town watches were always members of the community they patrolled with little-to-no special authority; they simply shared the responsibility of their community&amp;rsquo;s safety as part of living in that community.
Slave patrollers, meanwhile, were usually either paid a wage or more often a bounty for returned slaves, and had additional legal authorities beyond a normal citizen.</description>

      <title>Communism sounds good in theory, but it doesn&#39;t work in practice. Just look at countries like Venezuela. Look at what happened in Russia (the USSR).</title>

      <description>It is important to differentiate between a socialist/communist society, and a &amp;ldquo;socialist/communist&amp;rdquo; state (the latter does not exist beyond a mere label, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean much).
Venezuela is not a socialist country. It has State Capitalism and used oil money to fund welfare programs when oil production was high and prices were solid.
It&amp;rsquo;s also heavily sanctioned by foreign nations such as the United States.
The USSR also represented State Capitalism and faced several challenges, including a massive drought, and was actively worked against by foreign nations such as the United States.</description>

      <title>Cops have a hard job, and how do they know if some person is unarmed? If someone didn&#39;t follow directions, I&#39;d probably shoot them too. You have to listen to cops.</title>

      <description>Policing institutions have their roots in slave patrols, so just keep that in mind when you tell Black people that they &amp;ldquo;have to listen to cops.&amp;rdquo;
Cops may have a difficult job, but what seems more relevant is how dangerous it is (or isn&amp;rsquo;t).
Policing is not actually as dangerous in terms of fatalities per worker as numerous other jobs, including construction, logging, fishing, and agriculture. A lot of the cop fatalities we hear about are just car accidents and have nothing to do with intentional harm.</description>

      <description>While he wrote a paper supporting eugenics in his school years, he quickliy renounced the idea after seeing it implemented in Germany.
Once premier, he rejected pressure to implement an eugenics program despite other provinces doing so and instead created programs to help those he once called subnormal.
Source (the Medical Post (PDF)):
Today we read his thesis through the lens of history, after the Nazi’s genocidal policies forever warped eugenics into a grotesque social experiment.</description>

      <description>Many of our white comrades would say that our struggles do affect them, and that even if they didn&amp;rsquo;t, they would still care because they have a base level of care for other human beings.
Other people matter.
But let&amp;rsquo;s go one step further and say that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect you and other people don&amp;rsquo;t matter. It may very well affect you in the future, may it not? Why let it get to that point?</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s some tips on spotting bots:
How to Spot a Twitter Bot
 Many Twitter bots have a relatively recent creation date. Many bot user names contain numbers, which can indicate automatic name generation. The account primarily retweets content, rather than tweeting original content. The account’s tweet frequency is higher than a human user could feasibly achieve. The account may have a high number of followers and also be following a lot of accounts; conversely, some bot accounts are identifiable because they send a lot of tweets but only have a few followers.</description>

      <description>How do you think &amp;ldquo;Blacks&amp;rdquo; are going about it exactly? And how are you involved in helping us achieve what you &amp;ldquo;agree&amp;rdquo; with in your own personal life? Given our history and experiences in this country, how could you not understand and empathize with how different Black Americans are trying to respond to the various forms of oppression levied against us on a daily basis by our inherently racist economic system and government?</description>

      <description>This is called tone policing.
This implies that rhetoric matters more to you than actual ideas.
There is a time for a discussion of optics, but this is not usually appropriate over matters dealing with race and/or class.
One should judge ideas based off of what they are, not by how they are presented, although presentation and clarity play a significant role in our communications.
Obviously saying &amp;ldquo;white people are racist&amp;rdquo; (for example) is so simplistic that it&amp;rsquo;s almost useless, but if one knows how to read these statements and the intent behind them, then there is no problem in most cases.</description>

      <description>If you are against racism, you should look into how colonialists created &amp;ldquo;race,&amp;rdquo; and how Capitalists utilize &amp;ldquo;race&amp;rdquo; so that workers go against their own interests and profits can be maximized.
Ever-increasing profits is an unsustainable goal and, under Capitalism, the majority must eventually give from the bottom so that a select few can take from the top.
This is where racism (and race) becomes the Capitalist&amp;rsquo;s favorite tool.

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;d be had pressed to find someone who cared more about strangers than they cared about themselves and their immediate relatives and friends. Socialism can however be promoted based on purely selfish reasons if you so choose. If your friends or your family get sick or lose their jobs, do you want to be the one who has to take care of them and bear that financial burden? Probably not - so why not support a free and universal healthcare system, or a better unemployment system.</description>

      <description>If you don&amp;rsquo;t see color, then you don&amp;rsquo;t see the everyday struggles people go through because of color.
Color-blind ideology is a post Civil Rights, socially-sanctioned form of racism. It advocates that since the Civil Rights Movement, structural inequalities are insignificant and suggests that the best way to end the remnants of discrimination that still exist is by asserting that race does not matter.
Color-blindness accepts that racism is personal rather than societal and institutional.</description>

      <description>Recognizing race as a social construct does not make race less &amp;ldquo;real.&amp;rdquo;
Money is a social construct, but you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t burn your wallet, right?
Scientists generally do not recognize &amp;ldquo;race&amp;rdquo; as biologically meaningful, but race is socially real, not biologically real.
Race as a social construct is contingent on social groups and their collective agreement and acceptance of the constructions.
Race is something that is real in society, and that shapes the way we see ourselves and others.</description>

      <description>Most states require those on welfare to have a job or be job-searching, and the most effective welfare programs are those which give money to low-income workers.
The poor work harder than the average millionaire, taking sometimes two jobs just trying to avoid starvation and homelessness, and if they DO reach homelessness, no company will hire them since they will have no fixed address.
On the other hand, you have people who were born into wealthy families and haven&amp;rsquo;t worked hard for much of anything, or at best had a radically easier start than most others within society.</description>

      <description>Racism is not as simple as &amp;ldquo;hating all black people.&amp;rdquo;
It&amp;rsquo;s more accurate to say that racism is when one views one race as &amp;ldquo;innocent until proven guilty,&amp;rdquo; and another as &amp;ldquo;guilty until proven innocent.&amp;rdquo;
The fact that someone has black friends doesn&amp;rsquo;t say much, because it could be a case of &amp;ldquo;innocent until proven guilty,&amp;rdquo; but it could also be a case of &amp;ldquo;guilty until proven innocent.&amp;rdquo;
Whether or not someone has black friends doesn&amp;rsquo;t really say anything one way or another.</description>

You didn&amp;rsquo;t fight against the British in the Revolutionary War and you didn&amp;rsquo;t free the slaves, yet despite all that, we&amp;rsquo;d bet you&amp;rsquo;re proud to be an &amp;ldquo;American.&amp;rdquo;
If you&amp;rsquo;re going to take pride in your ancestors&amp;rsquo; accomplishments, it&amp;rsquo;s hypocritical to not take responsibility for their crimes.
Furthermore, you also directly benefit from the things your ancestors have done. In the same way that your grandparents being rich has an effect on your life, even if you don&amp;rsquo;t feel personally responsible, the racism of your ancestors has directly benefited you in ways you cannot deny or fathom without some reflection.</description>

      <description>You are one step away from understanding the underlying cause of oppression, Capitalism.
The underlying assumption of a race-only solution is that when racial groups are forced together (through law and regulation), they will work out their differences, i.e. the &amp;ldquo;melting pot.&amp;rdquo; The antebellum South in the U.S. or apartheid South Africa are examples of intense, daily contact and deep familiarity between dominant and dominated individuals, where contact didn&amp;rsquo;t diminish prejudice.</description>

      <description>We strongly disagree, but if what we are aiming to accomplish is merely &amp;ldquo;utopian&amp;rdquo; in your eyes (it&amp;rsquo;s not in ours), that means you can at least see the good in it.
You have one life; maybe help us create a new, &amp;ldquo;realistic&amp;rdquo; version of what we are aiming towards.
If the problem is that it&amp;rsquo;s not realistic, then join the discussion and help ground us. None of us here are dedicated to having our heads up our asses; we just want a better world than the one we are in.</description>

      <description>That&amp;rsquo;s good to hear. Now let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the institutions that oppress Black people and other people of color.
Structural racism is pervasive in U.S. policies, organizations, and across institutional domains, producing and sustaining racial inequality.
In the educational system, for example, minority students are graded differently and are disproportionately disciplined, and this causes many Black students to get left behind in said system, while their white counterparts move ahead.</description>

Are you referring to race reductionism (people who reduce everything to race)?
Are you referring to people with different backgrounds moving in self-determination?
We think it&amp;rsquo;s important that we differentiate between Liberal identity politics, and Leftist identity politics. The former is a tool used by (Neo)Liberals to keep poor and working-class people divided, while the latter is about ensuring less-represented voices and concerns get heard in an international movement to dismantle Capitalism.</description>

If anything, class reductionism has &amp;ldquo;ruined&amp;rdquo; the (actual) Left while Liberals (not Leftists) with no conception of an anti-racist and anti-capitalist future have co-opted inherently anticapitalist concepts rooted in identity.</description>

In The Meritocracy Myth, sociologists McNamee and Miller posited that while merit on economic outcomes is vastly overestimated, non-merit factors can suppress or negate efforts. Joseph Eugene Stiglitz, an American economist, said that the U.</description>

      <description>If we&amp;rsquo;re not going to delve into the entire failure of Reconstruction to put Black people on anywhere near an equal footing in our society&amp;hellip;
The first thing we need to understand is the cost of credit, i.e., the interest rates on loans. Black people being systematically deprived from being lent to means that the community will have more difficulty building up wealth.
The most recent is by not being privy to Federal Housing Association (FHA) loans in the post World War II economic boom, Black people were prevented from accumulating capital in home ownership.</description>

It also ignores Third Positionism as a potential &amp;ldquo;socialist&amp;rdquo; position that addresses one thing, but not the other.

      <description>If your ancestors wanted to live in America, maybe they should have learned some Indigenous/Native American languages (as well as some other things).
Okay, in all seriousness&amp;hellip;
The demand for immigrants to speak English is an ethnocentric mandate for cultural assimilation into a system of multicultural intolerance (translation: this is a self-centered, selfish, and narcissistic demand to make, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t sit on fair, even grounds).
The idea that penniless immigrants once came to this country and worked low-paying jobs to pull themselves up by their bootstraps to eventually reach equality of skills and income with &amp;ldquo;natives&amp;rdquo; is mostly false.</description>

      <description>By fearing (and thereby shunning) members of a minority group and discriminating against them in your day-to-day interactions, you help contribute to those very &amp;ldquo;statistics&amp;rdquo; that you loosely reference, which exist not because of some genetic predisposition to crime, but because certain groups face heavy, systemic discrimination.
The &amp;ldquo;statistics&amp;rdquo; only paint the picture you currently see when removed from the context in which they came into being, and if you were to actually examine the reasons for why those statistics are now skewed the way that they are, you would find that the only actual, reasonable solution here is to help end discrimination (the system of white supremacy) and as a result change those statistics for the better.</description>

      <description>Not all Black Americans are on welfare, so let&amp;rsquo;s try not to generalize here.
In fact, the greatest number of welfare recipients (by race) are white.
Let&amp;rsquo;s address this issue in relation to poor and working class Black Americans who are on welfare, though.
Giving financial support to the poor allows them to spend more of their income on the things they need. This is true even when cash is given with no strings attached, and no, poor folks do not spend whatever money is given to them on more drugs or alcohol, and studies indicate that if anything, financial support leads to less spending on drugs or alchohol.</description>

      <description>Did systemic racism as we understand it today exist prior to Capitalism (mercantile or otherwise)?
Racial categories were originally created to define an economic class: slaves.
In addition, they served as an ideological tool to prevent poor whites from allying with Black people who actually share their class interests.
Gender has also been used in order to regulate social roles.
These aren&amp;rsquo;t separate systems of oppression that &amp;ldquo;occasionally&amp;rdquo; intersect; they are fundamentally interconnected.</description>

      <description>Men have plenty to benefit from feminism.
Under patriarchy, men are expected to play their associated gender roles as well, and can be written off or alienated if they fail to do so.
Men who are in touch with their emotions, have a developed sense of empathy, who do not desire to enforce their will and dominate others, etc. are often mocked as &amp;ldquo;girly,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;gay,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;weak.&amp;rdquo;
In addition to all of the ways that feminism will liberate women, it will liberate men as well.</description>

      <description>MLK was literally murdered for his politics. He was also critical of the capitalist system starting in his 20s, so he would not be a Republican today.
MLK did not belong to or identify with either major political party, and at times called out both parties for having failed and betrayed Black Americans. His father was a Republican prior to the Civil Rights Movement, as were many Black Americans, for this was during a time when the Republican Party was seen as the Party of Lincoln.</description>

      <description>Because white people make up a bigger part of the U.S. population; there are about three times as many white people in America than there are black people, so obviously they will be the majority of pretty much everything.
If you look at the rates and not just the numbers, though, black people get shot by police at a higher rate.
Black people make up 12 to 13 percent of the population but 31% of the police shooting victims.</description>

      <description>In an ideal, post-racial world, yes.
But we do not live in this ideal, post-racial world.
We must address the very real, systemic racism together in order to work through the divisions and bring everyone onto the same page of action.
Furthermore, it is worth keeping in mind that Black Americans are not responsible for &amp;ldquo;race.&amp;rdquo; It is &amp;ldquo;white&amp;rdquo; people (Europeans) who created and developed &amp;ldquo;race&amp;rdquo; as a social construct.</description>

      <description>Cops already have overwhelmingly positive media coverage.
For example, news outlets typically says things like &amp;ldquo;suspect was killed in a police-involved shooting&amp;rdquo; rather than &amp;ldquo;police shot an unarmed and compliant civilian.&amp;rdquo;
It&amp;rsquo;s actually a vanishingly rare circumstance where the news gives police brutality fair coverage; the reason it stands out in your mind is because it&amp;rsquo;s such an unusual happening.
If the news reported on police brutality (and the corruption that follows in allowing such officers to go free without meaningful consequence) in an unbiased manner, it would take wall-to-wall coverage every day of the year to address the scope of this problem.</description>

      <description>Most people agree that compromise is essential in electoral politics and &amp;ldquo;politics&amp;rdquo; in general. The failure of politicians to compromise is often attributed to political polarization of our country – that is, for the Right and the Left to come to the middle. However, Gutmann and Thompson argue that there is an internal tension in political compromise in that the democratic process requires politicians both to resist compromise and to embrace it.</description>

      <title>Racism is just a thing that exists, like potholes. You have to understand that you can&#39;t get rid of it. It&#39;s natural to fear the other, and people organize along racial lines for this reason.</title>

      <description>Do you recommend we just live with potholes, or should we fix them?
Who defines the &amp;ldquo;other&amp;rdquo; and how do they define it? And why is it considered &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;fear&amp;rdquo; those who are different? Perhaps the solution is making it so that there is no fear between different people, and bringing people together both socially and economically.
People organize around &amp;ldquo;racial&amp;rdquo; lines in America because of the racialized institutions in our society, as well as their colonialist, white supremacist roots.</description>

The relationships between institutions such as the mainstream media and police must be understood in the larger context of Capitalism as a class-based economic system that benefits from and contributes to racism and violence.</description>

This stance completely overlooks the reality of voter suppression that Black Americans and other ethnic minorities have had to deal with.
Gerrymandering, social media manipulation, ex-offenders being indefinitely stripped of voting rights, and all forms of voter suppression are a far bigger threat to our semi-democratic institutions (what many call &amp;ldquo;democracy,&amp;rdquo; although we understand that Liberal representative &amp;ldquo;democracy&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t democracy at all) than Russian influence over our elections.</description>

      <description>[This is not the flag of the Confederacy.
](https://goo.gl/images/MdCn2E)[This](https://goo.gl/images/CV9y7Z) was the first national flag, followed by &amp;ldquo;The Stainless Banner&amp;rdquo; (also know as The White Man&amp;rsquo;s Flag) and then finally &amp;ldquo;[.&amp;rdquo;
The flag people call the &amp;ldquo;Confederate flag&amp;rdquo; is actually the Battle Flag of the Army of Tennessee (a square version was used by General Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia). It was not popularized until it was flown in &amp;ldquo;historical films&amp;rdquo; such as The Birth of a Nation, which is what inspired the second Klu Klux Klan.</description>

      <description>It is true that the name of the slave-owning political party was the Democratic Party. After the Civil War, that party continued its exploitation of the former slaves through the Jim Crow system. The former slave owners made up the southern wing of the Democratic Party. Starting approximately after WWII, the more &amp;ldquo;liberal&amp;rdquo; parts of the Democratic Party began to push for social reform, including racial reform. The southern Democrats were absolutely opposed to any reform.</description>

      <description>Immigrants largely work jobs that Americans no longer want to work, largely in the agriculture sector. Immigrants (undocumented and documented) also pay into the tax system in a net gain for the U.S. treasury. Additionally, U.S. birthrates are low to the point we need immigrants to help fill the gap (see here and here).
States with high levels of immigrants also see a LOWERING in crime rates. Immigrants (both documented and undocumented) commit fewer crimes than native born residents (see here and here).</description>

      <description>Were the Irish ever slaves (period)?
Yes, in the sense that people in what is now the Republic of Ireland enslaved each other and were abducted for forced labor by other peoples.
Were the Irish ever slaves during the period the Atlantic slave trade provided labor to the United States of America and the colonies that became that country?
No.
&amp;ldquo;Slave&amp;rdquo; is a term with incredibly varied meaning depending on the locality and period.</description>

Black American people have been speaking out about racial issues for centuries now (our ancestors were brought here as enslaved Africans, so this won&amp;rsquo;t change anytime soon).

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Morality&amp;rdquo; is perceived differently all over the world, and has changed throughout history. But not in any specific direction.
&amp;ldquo;Morality&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t easily quantifiable over time, as the moral axioms have changed. What is perceived by us as immoral today, was considered perfectly fine by people a century ago.
The definition of &amp;ldquo;justice&amp;rdquo; keeps changing, and so the &amp;ldquo;moral arc&amp;rdquo; tends to bend to justify ruling class domination.</description>

      <description>Although the prevalence of single parenthood is definitely an issue, it is not thee problem.
Thee problem is and always has been colonialism, capitalism, imperialism, and white supremacy (amongst many other things).
We have to ask ourselves why this particular issue that is mentioned is indeed so common, and analyze the issue through a more structuralist framework.
Black Americans are more negatively impacted by our racist criminal justice system and are therefore more likely to go to jail than if they were white.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Ways to be offended&amp;rdquo; is a common phrase among Conservatives reacting to &amp;ldquo;Political Correctness.&amp;rdquo; It is an example of how mainstream media exploits public fear and hatred as a social control mechanism.
There are various theories about the origins of the actual phrase, but until the 1980s in the United States, it was usually used ironically exclusively by the Left. It didn&amp;rsquo;t surface in mainstream American culture until 1990 when Richard Bernstein used it in a New York Times article to describe &amp;ldquo;unofficial ideology of the university .</description>

      <description>Black people (in the racial sense) aren&amp;rsquo;t inherently less intelligent than other races, and to posit otherwise would be entirely unscientific, because there is no scientific basis for such a claim. Black people, just like all other people, are shaped largely by their environments.
Now if you&amp;rsquo;d like to discuss the environments Black people have been shaped by, that&amp;rsquo;s another (much longer) discussion.
You could start with the fact that our ancestors came to the U.</description>

The troops (of all types of ethnicities) fight imperialist wars for oligarchs that don&amp;rsquo;t care about them.
The U.S. government has lied to its citizens to start the last six major wars on false pretenses.
The U.S. flag is not a symbol of hope, but of hate, to much of the world.

There is a common assumption that only the history of one&amp;rsquo;s own culture should be taught, perhaps with a little international &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo; stacked on top that either does not take into account what can be learned from the history of other cultures, or simply assumes one&amp;rsquo;s own culture is the most important.</description>

Telling people displaced and suffering because of policies put in place by your government to &amp;ldquo;stay and fight&amp;rdquo; is not only deeply inhumane, but nonsensical.
Also, who are these refugees supposed to fight for?
In a civil war, there are no obvious invading and defending forces.</description>

      <description>Equality is not &amp;ldquo;sameness.&amp;rdquo;
Equality acknowledges differences between people, but does not support distinctions such as race and gender as a basis for subjection.
Acknowledging differences is at the core of the concept of equality. In order for us to treat each other as equals, it is necessary that we first acknowledge and value our differences.
Treating people as equals is different than treating them the same. For instance, in education, giving students the same amounts of instruction, lessons, and identical learning materials is different than providing students with the necessary resources to reach educational goals and achieve academic success.</description>

      <description>Is the &amp;ldquo;politically correct&amp;rdquo; take something that you agree with deep down, but are too lazy to actually reflect in your own actions and/or words?
We understand that we are all conditioned and therefore carrying with us negative ideas or perspectives rooted in our childhoods or traditions, but it is on all of us to actively work to be better people.
Having some room to breathe and not overthink things is important, but if your words are reflecting negative ideas or sentiments, even though your intentions might not be in a bad place, it might be worth it to pause and reflect on what it is that you are promoting, and asking yourself if this is something that is in line with who you want to be as a human being.</description>

Welfare programs are a response to a problem, and our problem runs much deeper than what welfare programs alone can address.

      <description>This is a good opportunity to talk about the way that your position in life shapes the way you see things.
You don&amp;rsquo;t notice the ways that you benefit from being white because society has been (by and large) designed by people like you with you in mind. Bad things are less likely to happen to you because you are white – that isn&amp;rsquo;t to say that bad things couldn&amp;rsquo;t happen to you in spite of you being white, of course.</description>

      <title>What about Black on Black crime?</title>

      <description>Ahhh, the great myth of &amp;ldquo;Black-on-Black crime&amp;rdquo; is still with us.
This one was conjured up through a twisting of statistics around concentrated poverty paired with residential segregation.
The Atlanta Black Star cites a 2014 FBI report that shows us white Americans not only kill each other more frequently than any other racial group in America, but that there is only an eight percentage point margin between the rate at which Black Americans kill Black Americans, and the rate at which white people kill white people (in 2014, a Black American was killed by a member of the same race 90 percent of the time while a white person was killed by a member of the same race 82 percent of the time).</description>

      <description>Yet despite an increase in enrollment, Black Americans are still lagging behind in college population.
Many of the factors that contribute to one being able to attend college are inherited, meaning your family&amp;rsquo;s economic status is a strong indicator of whether you can attend college or not.
The wealth gap is extremely wide between white and Black, taken as an average or a median. A median white family has 10x the wealth of a median Black family.</description>

      <description>What happened to free speech in the context of &amp;ldquo;PC culture&amp;rdquo; is, at its core, dishonest.
The &amp;ldquo;free speech&amp;rdquo; argument displays a political spin of the group that has its hands on it.
It is used as a political tool rather than a concept to keep the combatants in the political arena honest.
There are no official rules, guidelines, or laws in favor of political correctness and against offensive speech.</description>

      <description>Assuming this is a Liberal talking point directed toward white Leftists, maybe we should clarify some things&amp;hellip;
Socialists are supposed to fight against ALL kinds of oppression, and this means oppression along the lines of race, gender, and more.
Many amongst the white working class are struggling to get jobs, as well as a living wage and general financial security.
That same oppression is not only replicated on other races and genders, but we (as Black Americans, for example) also have our own particular struggles with racism (and others are dealing with even more struggles on top of this, like misogyny or transphobia, for example).</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;White&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t a nationality, let alone an ethnic category - it is an extremely broad grouping based strictly upon skin color and other physical features, and a grouping so broad that one is basically saying that they are proud to not be an ethnic minority in saying that they are &amp;ldquo;proud to be white.&amp;rdquo;
There is no culture of &amp;ldquo;whiteness.&amp;rdquo;
You cannot conflate the achievements of the Scandinavians with those of the Italians, and the achievements of the Italians with those of the British, and so on and so forth.</description>

      <description>Do you know any Black people personally?
This question implies that all Black people are poor.
Although there is a clear and major wealth gap, we as Black Americans have a class system too, for the record (and have had one for quite some time).
We can respond to this question two reasonable ways:
  Why do you think poor people just want &amp;ldquo;handouts&amp;rdquo; (as you call them)?
  Why are Black people disproportionately poor?</description>

      <description>What would a &amp;ldquo;white&amp;rdquo; history month celebrate, exactly?
Whiteness was invented by Europeans who wanted to assure a portion of their workers that they weren&amp;rsquo;t under threat of becoming disposable slaves like the others; the distinguishing quality of whiteness is its social relation to blackness.</description>

      <description>Because the color of your skin predicts many of the outcomes you will experience in your life.
Where racists will point to these facts and, incorrectly, claim these are essential and immutable qualities of the races, Socialists understand that these material conditions are caused by institutions of power, both formal and informal, that exist to support some over others (principally, the ruling class over the working class).
Because race can be used as a wedge to divide us, society is structured to benefit some people over others.</description>

      <description>Maybe you not having to deal with trouble from cops has less to do with being &amp;ldquo;polite&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;following orders,&amp;rdquo; and more to do with not being Black. Either way, your rationale is purely anecdotal.</description>

      <description>Black fatherlessness and gun violence are things that are absolutely talked about within America, but the biggest problem here is with regard to the diagnosis of why these issues are so prevalent and what the solutions are to fix them.
The attack on the &amp;ldquo;Black family&amp;rdquo; and the scourge of gun violence can be traced to some clear material causes:
  The drug wars that disproportionately target Black communities.</description>

      <description>Certainly you aren&amp;rsquo;t trying to imply that there is something inherent about black people that makes them predisposed to failure.
You just answered your own question.
Under a capitalist system, the incentive for any nation-state (and most private interests) isn&amp;rsquo;t to &amp;ldquo;help&amp;rdquo; African nations become &amp;ldquo;developed&amp;rdquo; for the benefit of Africans, but rather for the benefit of corporations (and more broadly, the global capitalist class) so that they may be in a better position to exploit the resources that Africa has to offer.</description>

      <description>We can not just advocate for ending Capitalist oppression, but we can also put specific ways in which the Black community is oppressed in the spotlight, while advocating for equality.
Not having that additional input from a marginalized community might end up perpetuating oppression from society, even if the socialist revolution succeeds.
This might be independent from actual policy. Maybe a Socialist leader is not antisemitic or racist, but without educating the people, any socialist policy&amp;rsquo;s effect will be dampened.</description>

      <description>Technically, it is correct that anyone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t defend marginalized people who look physically different than them, even when choosing to be neutral, is a racist in some way.
The foundation of Western society is based upon the construction of whiteness, which led to white supremacy. Those who are not being oppressed by the system of whiteness are usually those who uphold this system, and deny that systemic racism exists. These people who consciously or unconsciously defend whiteness could be anyone from average working-class folks, to Liberals, to &amp;ldquo;Brocialists,&amp;rdquo; to all-out reactionaries.</description>

      <description>Hmmm&amp;hellip; interesting.
In our view, straight (cishet) white men have been getting special treatment, instead of being equals to the rest of society.
Virtually any other demographic that is not white, cisgender, or male, has been on a disproportionate struggle of their own, no? It would be hard to argue that this has not been the case.
So what does that make our demands exactly? Furthermore, maybe you&amp;rsquo;re not exactly informed on what our demands are as Black American Socialists.</description>

Right-wing violence is caused by racist dog whistles that drive xenophobic hatred.
Right-wing violence is caused by the spreading of lies about ethnic minorities.
Right-wing violence is caused by the presence of Donald Trump on Infowars.
Right-wing violence is caused by having anti-Semitic &amp;ldquo;political commentators&amp;rdquo; on television spreading disinformation.</description>
