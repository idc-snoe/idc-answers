<p>This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_policing">tone policing</a>.</p>
<p>This implies that rhetoric matters more to you than actual ideas.</p>
<p>There is a time for a discussion of optics, but this is not usually appropriate over matters dealing with race and/or class.</p>
<p>One should judge ideas based off of what they are, not by how they are presented, although presentation and clarity play a significant role in our communications.</p>
<p>Obviously saying &ldquo;white people are racist&rdquo; (for example) is so simplistic that it&rsquo;s almost useless, but if one knows how to read these statements and the intent behind them, then there is no problem in most cases. A majority of people, however, lack the understanding to read these kinds of statements correctly.</p>
<p>Tone policing isn&rsquo;t the solution to this problem, and neither is telling people to educate themselves.</p>
<p>People are always going to be reactionary and interpret statements according to how they make them feel. It&rsquo;s up to us collectively to educate people over time, and with patience.</p>
