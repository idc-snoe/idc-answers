About Us
<p>
We're a leftist organizing body dedicated to coordinating and supporting citizen projects which lay the local groundwork for revolution.

<p>

We operate from a place of love for all and a sense of urgency in affecting real change which achieves our collective potential. We believe workers should control the means of production in a democratic and decentralized world.
